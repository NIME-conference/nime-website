  abstract  = {Artificial Analog Neural Network (AANN) is an interactive, handmade electronic sculpture that responds to environmental stimuli in a display of light and sound. AANN’s structure is a skeletal point-to-point soldered network of analog electronic components designed to approximate biological neural network behavior. The sculpture is a 45 neuron network whose form was influenced in part by multi-layered network models used in neural computing, and by the Fibonacci based branching of natural systems. During the design process, studies of early marine and plant life became the primary inspiration for AANN’s final form. AANN is situated at the intersection of art and science, making physical the abstract processes used by computer scientists in pattern recognition. As guests speak or cast shadows on AANN the abrupt changes in sound and light cause the network to react by producing a series of swoops and chirps, and by illuminating LEDs on active neurons; sounds are converted into chirps and twitters, made visual by the LEDs indicating activity in the network. What is heard and seen are the actual pulse streams being transmitted from one neuron to the next throughout the entire network.},

Listeners can change the nature of the sound by casting shadows over the solar panel, or over individual sound lanterns. The piece relies entirely on sunlight available in the moment. In most PV applications, the solar panel is actually supplying current to a battery or a capacitor, thus “buffering” the power. In this piece, I wanted to experiment with using the sun’s raw energy directly, without regulating the voltage in any way. Therefore, these sound makers go through many changes as the sunlight waxes and wanes. Each lantern features a slightly different sound-making circuit, thus the four voices are unique and, when sounding together, create a chorus of sun-powered chattering, squealing, buzzing, and humming. Listeners should feel free to “play” the lanterns together by casting shadows, touching the solar panels, or slightly tilting the panels. The performance of these devices is variable and depends upon the amount of sunlight available: if it is dark, they make no sound; in dim light, sound is non-existent, or very soft and subtle. In bright sunlight, they scream and wail loudly.},

Technology is used to examine the sounds around us, but also to include those parts of our personal soundscape that are augmented by technology, by the addition of the cellphone to our acoustic world.

There are two distinct audio elements. The first is a “bed” created by an ambient microphone. This recording is regeneratively looped at intervals that coincide directly to the timings of Cage’s original score. Changes are injected in key parameters of the “looping” to perturb and rearrange the material already captured in the previous section.

The second element is the “cellphone opera” score that takes input from participants and redistributes the audio material from the calls to specific slots in a prearranged “score”. Each new call rearranges the entire score as the recordings move to a new temporally ordered location in the 4 minute and 33 second time frame. “At the beep” participant callers are prompted to respond to randomly chosen requests. “Make the sound of a radio out of tune” “Tell us about Cage’s 4’33” performance.” “What is your mother’s name?” “Did David Tudor like mushrooms?” Each cellphone call will be recorded for 4 seconds and 330 milliseconds.},

Participants manipulate a spatialized soundscape that is directly controlled by the positions and motions of the pendaphones. Each of the pendaphones can be raised and lowered in height, and the trajectory of a swing directly controls the sounds emanating from a loudspeaker mounted above. The pendaphones are attached to spring-retracting cords that pull them toward the ceiling, and are counter-weighted by their interaction nodes at the bottom in order to attain neutral buoyancy. Multiple channels of loudspeakers spatialize the generated sounds, enhancing the sense of physical immersion in the piece.

Pendaphonics focuses on explorative, collaborative performance, combining artistic qualities with social activities and play. Visitors playing the pendaphones evoke a soundscape through ensemble interaction, producing a wide range of musical sounds via the many different combinations of inputs. One mode allows each pendaphone to control a large virtual turntable that allows scratching and other DJ type effects, while another enables control of a virtual Tibetan bowl in which audio is generated through physical modeling synthesis. Other playful sounds encourage sonic games involving bouncing, pulling, pushing, swinging in circles and collaborating with other users to generate sounds of trembles, shudders, shakes, and collisions that can be enjoyed by participants and observers alike.},

Using motion tracking in conjunction with an overhead speaker array, Elemental harvests the motion of visitors in the exhibit space and augments their location and trajectory with water ripples, thus generating a surreal sensation of traversing waist-deep water. As an acknowledgment of visitors’ communal presence, the collisions among individual ripples produce algorithmically synthesized aural fireworks, resulting in an ever-changing soundscape that transforms architectural space into a musical box of infinite possibilities.

Cyrene Reefs complements Elemental as an intricate mythical instrument. Populated with holes and fissures resembling stops of a woodwind instrument, the Reef begs to be explored by hands. Akin to the notion of virtuosity, the Reef reveals little of its true potential to the impatient, rewarding only those who choose to persist},

Whisker Organ is an interactive sound instrument linking the voices of a 30-person chorus with 48 black cat whiskers. Through touch, visitors to the piece activate the sound of massed voices singing, creating spontaneous, infinitely-variable musical compositions. Whisker Organ is built on a system of  piezoelectric sensors connected to a series of microprocessors, which in turn control sound output to an external speaker system. The sonic experience is oversized, unexpected, and richly human. The tactile experience is mysterious, perhaps evoking a frisson of discomfort, but also inescapably compelling. Whisker Organ both requires and enables the leap of imagination necessary to make sense of the joining of two organic but otherwise unconnected references. Whisker Organ was created in collaboration with the Oriana Consort who performed the vocal notes for the instrument. The music that forms the basis of Whisker Organ's sound output was composed in 2011 by Walter Chapin.

``Aura: Presence/without$^*$ Manual'' is a soundsculpture which functions as a transducer converting motion into sound in the form of a pendulum. The loudspeaker becomes the interactive means through which movement can become sound. Its internal functions corresponds to the behaviour of the human element. The live-object is built to react to its human counterpart in order to achieve the lightness of a sound-element in flux.
With the hand as a source, the visual aspect of the object`s motion and the acoustic are combined with the movement and result in creating acoustic and visual correspondences. These correpondences enable the comprehension of a system which is created by the interaction itself, a game of balance which can keep us immersed in a minimum amount of information.

Halfway between instrument and sculpture, Strings is a sound installation that invites participants to play, hear and move within a space, becoming part of a musical instrument. Strands of thread are tensed in oblique planes---from ceiling to floor, from wall to wall---, defining an architectural space that invites visitors in. Once inside, they become performers, moving through the space to find different ranges of pitch and timbres in the instrument that surrounds them. The sounds are generated synthetically but, as is the case with traditional acoustic instruments, the experience includes texture, space, color and movement.

Mutatis Mutandis is a multi-sensory installation that uses glaciological data to control an audio and visual environment. This data is interpreted in several ways including using the data to control parameters of sound files containing actual recorded glaciers (calving, ice-cracking, melting, sheet friction, etc.) and processing the data to synthesize sound and visualizations. The glacial sounds were collected from researchers and acousticians across the world, much of it field recorded in Antarctica. These audio-processes are distributed to several speakers located around the space.

Because glaciological change can take place over extremely long durations of time, this installation exposes various characteristics of glaciological history by accelerating their rates of change. To symbolize the real-time aspect of glaciological change, a large ice block is placed in the middle of the space, slowly melting throughout the installation's duration.

This project uses data taken from all over the world including WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), CrESIS (Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets) and the US census bureau.

Cor Cordis is an interactive sculpture for collaborative biofeedback performance. The light sculpture responds to changes in the heart rate and respiratory movements of individual participants, providing them with an audiovisual representation of their biofeedback in real-time.

Up to four participants are asked to wear wireless sensor devices and this data is used to generate algorithmic composition and accompanying light feedback. Participants can work together to develop a collaborative performance, engineering changes through breathing and heart rate.

Artist(s) Biography:

Clare Cullen is a sound artist, experimental musician and researcher interested in developing interactive systems for music performance. She has an MSc in Digital Composition and Performance from the University of Edinburgh and is currently studying towards a PhD in Media and Arts Technology at Queen Mary University, London.

Evan Morgan completed his undergraduate studies in Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London, in 2008. His Masters Research project was a collaborative study with the Royal College of Music, investigating the physiological aspects of performance anxiety in classically trained musicians. This research led him towards an interest in the ways in which live physiological data can be used in art, media and performance. In particular he is interested in utilising automated methods of detecting human emotion in order to study the dynamics of emotion within audiences. He is currently studying in the first year of the Media and Arts Technology Ph.D. programme at Queen Mary University, London.},
