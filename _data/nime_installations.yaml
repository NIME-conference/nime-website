  abstract: "Program notes:\n\nMutatis Mutandis is a multi-sensory installation that\
    \ uses glaciological data to control an audio and visual environment. This data\
    \ is interpreted in several ways including using the data to control parameters\
    \ of sound files containing actual recorded glaciers (calving, ice-cracking, melting,\
    \ sheet friction, etc.) and processing the data to synthesize sound and visualizations.\
    \ The glacial sounds were collected from researchers and acousticians across the\
    \ world, much of it field recorded in Antarctica. These audio-processes are distributed\
    \ to several speakers located around the space.\n\nBecause glaciological change\
    \ can take place over extremely long durations of time, this installation exposes\
    \ various characteristics of glaciological history by accelerating their rates\
    \ of change. To symbolize the real-time aspect of glaciological change, a large\
    \ ice block is placed in the middle of the space, slowly melting throughout the\
    \ installation's duration.\n\nThis project uses data taken from all over the world\
    \ including WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), NOAA (National Oceanic and\

  abstract: 'The Tremolo-Chimes is an interactive performance system that consists
    of a set of tubular metallic wind chimes that have been modified by removing the
    striker and wind catcher. MIDI-controlled vibration motors suspended in each chime
    produce continuous, tremolo-like sounds where the dynamic shape can be controlled
    over time. This system is inspired by acoustic wind chimes and explores questions
    about performative agency in automated instruments. The Tremolo-Chimes interactive
    installation employs multiple control methods, including synthesized wind and
    sensors that detect the proximity of participants to the chimes. Both synthesized
    wind and sensor input are fed through a mass-link physical model, evoking the
    movements of a wind-driven clapper bouncing off traditional wind chimes. Synthesized
    wind represents the default control mode of the installation when participants
    are not interacting with the sensors. When a participant enters the sensing field,
    their body will actuate the chimes similarly to how a percussionist uses their
    hand to sweep across a set of chimes.'

  abstract: '“near and far” is an interactive sound and light installation that explores
    how proximity influences our perception of sound in space and our relationships
    with people, places, and things. The installation aims to provide co-creative
    agency to the audience, whose presence and actions uniquely define the experience
    of the work. Movement is sonified in the space via a distance sensor and audience
    members may turn on and off a collection of three lights to toggle between soundscapes
    and musical compositions. The soundscapes and compositions range from abstract
    electronic sounds, to fully-fledged song / composition arrangements, to everyday
    sounds like wind, waves, and urban transit. The multiplicity of sonic spaces was
    inspired by the author’s belief that embodying plurality is a core facet of being

    to resonate emotionally or otherwise engage.'

  abstract: 'Artificial Analog Neural Network (AANN) is an interactive, handmade electronic
    sculpture that responds to environmental stimuli in a display of light and sound.
    AANN’s structure is a skeletal point-to-point soldered network of analog electronic
    components designed to approximate biological neural network behavior. The sculpture
    is a 45 neuron network whose form was influenced in part by multi-layered network
    models used in neural computing, and by the Fibonacci based branching of natural
    systems. During the design process, studies of early marine and plant life became
    the primary inspiration for AANN’s final form. AANN is situated at the intersection
    of art and science, making physical the abstract processes used by computer scientists
    in pattern recognition. As guests speak or cast shadows on AANN the abrupt changes
    in sound and light cause the network to react by producing a series of swoops
    and chirps, and by illuminating LEDs on active neurons; sounds are converted into
    chirps and twitters, made visual by the LEDs indicating activity in the network.
    What is heard and seen are the actual pulse streams being transmitted from one
    neuron to the next throughout the entire network.'

  abstract: 'Sound Lanterns is an interactive sound installation that is powered by
    the sun, and emits sounds based on the amount of sunlight available, as well as
    on the amount of light that falls on light sensors on each of the four lanterns
    themselves. Listeners can change the nature of the sound by casting shadows over
    the solar panel, or over individual sound lanterns. The piece relies entirely
    on sunlight available in the moment. In most PV applications, the solar panel
    is actually supplying current to a battery or a capacitor, thus “buffering” the
    power. In this piece, I wanted to experiment with using the sun’s raw energy directly,
    without regulating the voltage in any way. Therefore, these sound makers go through
    many changes as the sunlight waxes and wanes. Each lantern features a slightly
    different sound-making circuit, thus the four voices are unique and, when sounding
    together, create a chorus of sun-powered chattering, squealing, buzzing, and humming.
    Listeners should feel free to “play” the lanterns together by casting shadows,
    touching the solar panels, or slightly tilting the panels. The performance of
    these devices is variable and depends upon the amount of sunlight available: if
    it is dark, they make no sound; in dim light, sound is non-existent, or very soft
    and subtle. In bright sunlight, they scream and wail loudly.'

  abstract: "Cellphonia: 4’33” is a tribute to the concept embodied in John Cage’s\
    \ landmark piece, 4’33”. It is a structural and aesthetic construct that is a\
    \ formal expansion of the piece. Technology is used to examine the sounds around\
    \ us, but also to include those parts of our personal soundscape that are augmented\
    \ by technology, by the addition of the cellphone to our acoustic world.\n\nThere\
    \ are two distinct audio elements. The first is a “bed” created by an ambient\
    \ microphone. This recording is regeneratively looped at intervals that coincide\
    \ directly to the timings of Cage’s original score. Changes are injected in key\
    \ parameters of the “looping” to perturb and rearrange the material already captured\
    \ in the previous section.\n\nThe second element is the “cellphone opera” score\
    \ that takes input from participants and redistributes the audio material from\
    \ the calls to specific slots in a prearranged “score”. Each new call rearranges\
    \ the entire score as the recordings move to a new temporally ordered location\
    \ in the 4 minute and 33 second time frame. “At the beep” participant callers\
    \ are prompted to respond to randomly chosen requests. “Make the sound of a radio\
    \ out of tune” “Tell us about Cage’s 4’33” performance.” “What is your mother’s\
    \ name?” “Did David Tudor like mushrooms?” Each cellphone call will be recorded\
    \ for 4 seconds and 330 milliseconds."

    \ wide range of musical sounds via the many different combinations of inputs.\
    \ One mode allows each pendaphone to control a large virtual turntable that allows\
    \ scratching and other DJ type effects, while another enables control of a virtual\
    \ Tibetan bowl in which audio is generated through physical modeling synthesis.\
    \ Other playful sounds encourage sonic games involving bouncing, pulling, pushing,\
