  abstract: "Program notes:\n\nMutatis Mutandis is a multi-sensory installation that\
    \ uses glaciological data to control an audio and visual environment. This data\
    \ is interpreted in several ways including using the data to control parameters\
    \ of sound files containing actual recorded glaciers (calving, ice-cracking, melting,\
    \ sheet friction, etc.) and processing the data to synthesize sound and visualizations.\
    \ The glacial sounds were collected from researchers and acousticians across the\
    \ world, much of it field recorded in Antarctica. These audio-processes are distributed\
    \ to several speakers located around the space.\n\nBecause glaciological change\
    \ can take place over extremely long durations of time, this installation exposes\
    \ various characteristics of glaciological history by accelerating their rates\
    \ of change. To symbolize the real-time aspect of glaciological change, a large\
    \ ice block is placed in the middle of the space, slowly melting throughout the\
    \ installation's duration.\n\nThis project uses data taken from all over the world\
    \ including WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), NOAA (National Oceanic and\
    \ Atmospheric Administration), CrESIS (Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets)\
    \ and the US census bureau.\n\nArtist(s) Biography:\n\nNolan Lem (b. 1986 Kansas\
    \ City, MO) is an instrumentalist and composer whose work reflects a broad range\
    \ of influences and mediums. His music has been performed all over the United\
    \ States and abroad including festivals in Norway, Italy, Switzerland and Finland.\
    \ As a saxophonist, he has performed at the Lincoln Center, Dizzy's Coca Cola\
    \ Jazz Club and the Highline Ball room in New York City. He has been the recipient\
    \ of several grants for installations involving the University of Kansas and the\
    \ Spencer Art Museum. He has studied at the Sibelius Academy, Eastman School,\
    \ the University of Kansas and holds a degree from the University of Miami (FL).\
    \ He currently resides in Lawrence, KS where he is pursuing a degree in electrical\
    \ engineering at the University of Kansas.\n\nTristan Telander (b. 1984 Wichita,\
    \ KS) is a University of Kansas Visual Communications graduate currently employed\
    \ as the Graphic Designer with the Spencer Museum of Art where she develops print,\
    \ environmental, and digital materials. Her award-winning work---ranging from\
    \ annual reports to exterior building banners---enhances the Spencer's multifaceted\
    \ environment. Recently, she has been a recipient of two American Association\

    \ of visual communication as it changes with technological advances with regard\
    \ to the environment.\n\nBryan Kip Haaheim joined the faculty at KU in 2001 as\
    \ an assistant professor of Music Composition. He currently teaches Composition,\
    \ Electronic Music, and Music Theory. Kip Received his D.M.A degree from the University\

  abstract: 'Artificial Analog Neural Network (AANN) is an interactive, handmade electronic
    sculpture that responds to environmental stimuli in a display of light and sound.
    AANN’s structure is a skeletal point-to-point soldered network of analog electronic
    components designed to approximate biological neural network behavior. The sculpture
    is a 45 neuron network whose form was influenced in part by multi-layered network
    models used in neural computing, and by the Fibonacci based branching of natural
    systems. During the design process, studies of early marine and plant life became
    the primary inspiration for AANN’s final form. AANN is situated at the intersection
    of art and science, making physical the abstract processes used by computer scientists
    in pattern recognition. As guests speak or cast shadows on AANN the abrupt changes
    in sound and light cause the network to react by producing a series of swoops
    and chirps, and by illuminating LEDs on active neurons; sounds are converted into
    chirps and twitters, made visual by the LEDs indicating activity in the network.

  abstract: 'Sound Lanterns is an interactive sound installation that is powered by
    the sun, and emits sounds based on the amount of sunlight available, as well as
    on the amount of light that falls on light sensors on each of the four lanterns
    themselves. Listeners can change the nature of the sound by casting shadows over
    the solar panel, or over individual sound lanterns. The piece relies entirely
    on sunlight available in the moment. In most PV applications, the solar panel
    is actually supplying current to a battery or a capacitor, thus “buffering” the
    power. In this piece, I wanted to experiment with using the sun’s raw energy directly,
    without regulating the voltage in any way. Therefore, these sound makers go through
    many changes as the sunlight waxes and wanes. Each lantern features a slightly
    different sound-making circuit, thus the four voices are unique and, when sounding
    together, create a chorus of sun-powered chattering, squealing, buzzing, and humming.
    Listeners should feel free to “play” the lanterns together by casting shadows,
    touching the solar panels, or slightly tilting the panels. The performance of
    these devices is variable and depends upon the amount of sunlight available: if
    it is dark, they make no sound; in dim light, sound is non-existent, or very soft
    and subtle. In bright sunlight, they scream and wail loudly.'

    \ parameters of the “looping” to perturb and rearrange the material already captured\
    \ in the previous section.\n\nThe second element is the “cellphone opera” score\
    \ that takes input from participants and redistributes the audio material from\
    \ the calls to specific slots in a prearranged “score”. Each new call rearranges\
    \ the entire score as the recordings move to a new temporally ordered location\

    The work alludes to concerns about generative AI creating a monoculture through

    with (and simultaneously serving as a critique of) MusicGen’s innate tendency

    The layering of multiple samples also allows us to produce a real-time participatory

    as the interface through which an audio reference is created by participants,

  abstract: 'Token Telephone is a co-creative AI sound installation. Participants
    enter a space equipped with a microphone and a quartet of generative sound neural
    networks, each represented by a loudspeaker. Upon vocalizing into the microphone,
    the participants'' utterance is transformed into neural acoustic tokens and played
    back, initiating a game of telephone between the neural networks. Each network
    encodes, processes and reconstructs the sound, distorting the original utterance
    into new textures guided by the network''s training data. The newly reconfigured
    sound is then passed to the next network/loudspeaker in a clockwise direction,
    and the process repeats. The sound produced by the fourth network is passed back
    to the first network in the cycle, creating a feedback loop wherein the original
    utterance incrementally loses all of its original characteristics and disintegrates
    into textures that reflect the inherent biases of the generative models in play.
    In time, the resonant properties of the processes are revealed in front of the
    participant. Inspired by the popular children''s game of telephone, Token Telephone
    illuminates the gradual formation of hallucinations through the iterative processing
    and re-processing of audio, reflecting the biases introduced by the model''s understanding
    of sound objects, as well as the data that was provided to it.  '

    to the sonar of a bat — creating an interactive musical ‘Bat-Theme’. Hence, it
    is not only questioning the hard problem of consciousness and the line between

  abstract: 'The Jellyfish is a species with one of the most simplistic and complete
    Umwelts. Its pulsating movements are caused by a refined network, composing only
    of a few neurons. These neural receptors, named Rhopalia, receive external simulation
    which determines their pulses. In the ocean, these pulses then ripple into waves
    in the water, that is sensed by the Rhopalia, triggering the pulses of the next
    jellyfish. Such interactions (that cannot be seen by the naked eye) in repetition
    over time, have sustained the existence of the jellyfish species across 6 billion
    years. This mechanical system causes organic pulses, radiating an inexplicable
    feeling of vitality. ‘Sonic Rhopalia’ is a sound installation that is produced
    by the pulsation of four Aurelia aurita (a.k.a. moon jellyfish). By using Touch
    Designer and a web camera to capture the movement of each jellyfish, we detect
    its pulse through image analysis, using OpenCV and a combination of pixel color
    channel classification and area calculation. Once the pulse of a jellyfish is
    detected, it sends a bang to M4L (Max for Live) using OSC (OpenSound Control),
    where it is used as a trigger for music composition. Sounds are played in response
    to each pulse, and when the jellyfish pulse at the same time, in synchronization,
    different chords and sounds are produced. The work develops across one loop comprising
    of three phases with varying soundscapes, all determined by the number pulse synchronizations.
    By reframing jellyfish as an interface for music generation, the rhythms and movements

    flow information to dynamically transform the visual and auditory expressions
    of a ‘Hokora’ integrating changes in light, shadow, and music based on the movements
    and tendencies of people, ultimately creating an interactive environment where
    the shrine and individuals mutually influence each other. ‘Hokora’ is a miniature
    Shinto shrine on a street side, and in Japan, it is a common practice to stop
    or bow when passing by. Through the faith in the shrine, the environment, or human
    flow, also undergoes changes. In this work, the information from the surrounding
    human flow is reflected in the presentation of light and shadow reminiscent of
    dappled sunlight, causing the visual and auditory expressions of the Hokora to
    change based on people''s actions and further influencing the environment. In
    this work, three ultrasonic distance sensor values are used as input, and the
    detection frequency and distance values of the past 10 detections are recorded
    for each sensor. The recorded detection frequency is used to calculate the congestion
    level of the surrounding human flow. Based on these two pieces of human flow information,
    changes are introduced in the movement of lights controlled by motors (DC and
    servo), creating shadow play and altering the music output. This contributes to
    the portrayal of light inspired by dappled sunlight. The density of human flow
    influences the left and right movement of lights, reflecting the intensity of
    the light''s movement. On the other hand, in the realm of music, the density of
    human flow modulates the frequency of high-pass and low-pass filters. By offering
    viewers an expression of the Hokora that changes based on human flow information,
    this installation creates an effect where the Hokora and people mutually influence
    each other, a phenomenon not traditionally seen in Hokora.'

  abstract: 'Five robots playing five tuned bells by striking them with a mallet.
    Each robot is controlled by a minimalist, neurally inspired analogue oscillator.
    These oscillators are mutually connected and connected to a pacemaker oscillator,
    and through network connectivity, they will synchronize at different ratios with
    the pacemaker. Slow-running analog oscillators of the same type switch on and
    off the connectivity and modulate the activation of the robots'' oscillators.
    Only through these changing network configurations does a musical score that alternates
    between coordinated polyrhythms, random structure and moments of silence emerges.

  abstract: 'The Tremolo-Chimes is an interactive performance system that consists
    of a set of tubular metallic wind chimes that have been modified by removing the
    striker and wind catcher. MIDI-controlled vibration motors suspended in each chime
    produce continuous, tremolo-like sounds where the dynamic shape can be controlled
    over time. This system is inspired by acoustic wind chimes and explores questions
    about performative agency in automated instruments. The Tremolo-Chimes interactive
    installation employs multiple control methods, including synthesized wind and
    sensors that detect the proximity of participants to the chimes. Both synthesized
    wind and sensor input are fed through a mass-link physical model, evoking the
    movements of a wind-driven clapper bouncing off traditional wind chimes. Synthesized
    wind represents the default control mode of the installation when participants
    are not interacting with the sensors. When a participant enters the sensing field,
    their body will actuate the chimes similarly to how a percussionist uses their

  abstract: '"Song of Distances" is a participatory and algorithmic composition based
    on ubiquitous computing. It praises the concept of compressed time/space and connectivity.
    Each login session is represented as a node in the topographic coordinate by granting
    access to GPS data by the user. The system calculates the session period and relative
    distances between the center and each node to generate m. At the same time, the
    orientation affects the spatiality of the sound, transforming the positioning
    data into audible events. Each networked entity that contributes data to the system
    is the center point of its coordinate and a detective node on other devices. The
    user can close the webpage or keep it open while moving; all of the behavior and
    decisions reflect on the parameters of the generative music. Thus, this piece
    gradually evolves with crowd participation as a collective experience on the Internet.'

  abstract: 'This work is a sound installation using dome architecture and a large
    woofer 80 cm in diameter. The "sacrifice" is made by having one person lie on
    top of the woofer and surrounding it for viewing. The audience is enveloped in
    the story by viewing a lone person lying on top of a large speaker, as if offering
    a sacrifice in a ritualistic way, thereby drawing the audience members into the
    narrative. In addition, the very large bass, consisting of woofers, gives a sense
    of presence and eeriness. The sound flowing from here is based on the traditional
    folk tales of "Bon-Bon Shark" that remains in the Japanese town of Manazuru and
    composed as a Soundscape composition. The story is about a couple sharks who are
    killed by a bell dropped from a boat by a sailor, and sacrifices are made to these
    sharks.'

  abstract: 'LOOP is an interactive sound object made from green polyester strapping
    tape. The sound that arises from the interaction with the object is picked up
    by a contact microphone and amplified. Due to the material qualities of the polyester
    tape which allows sound to travel through the tape (approx. 100 meters) it is
    possible to sense the acoustic interaction through one single piezo-microphone.
    The sound is composed of a low rumble that derives from the length of the tape.
    Combined with some higher pitched and rich blended interaction sounds from scratching
    and hitting the LOOP. The object combines haptic, tactile, visual and acoustic
    qualities. It can be touched, squeezed and ”played”by the audience. LOOP was created
    within the Textile and Sound research project by Gertrud Fischbacher and Marius

    life-sized wooden sculptures that produce different audio-visual effects. Each
    sculpture has its own Arduino-based interface that enables it to respond to the
