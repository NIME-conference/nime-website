  abstract: 'Sound Lanterns is an interactive sound installation that is powered by
    the sun, and emits sounds based on the amount of sunlight available, as well as
    on the amount of light that falls on light sensors on each of the four lanterns
    themselves. Listeners can change the nature of the sound by casting shadows over
    the solar panel, or over individual sound lanterns. The piece relies entirely
    on sunlight available in the moment. In most PV applications, the solar panel
    is actually supplying current to a battery or a capacitor, thus “buffering” the
    power. In this piece, I wanted to experiment with using the sun’s raw energy directly,
    without regulating the voltage in any way. Therefore, these sound makers go through
    many changes as the sunlight waxes and wanes. Each lantern features a slightly
    different sound-making circuit, thus the four voices are unique and, when sounding
    together, create a chorus of sun-powered chattering, squealing, buzzing, and humming.
    Listeners should feel free to “play” the lanterns together by casting shadows,
    touching the solar panels, or slightly tilting the panels. The performance of
    these devices is variable and depends upon the amount of sunlight available: if
    it is dark, they make no sound; in dim light, sound is non-existent, or very soft
    and subtle. In bright sunlight, they scream and wail loudly.'

  abstract: "Cellphonia: 4’33” is a tribute to the concept embodied in John Cage’s\
    \ landmark piece, 4’33”. It is a structural and aesthetic construct that is a\
    \ formal expansion of the piece. Technology is used to examine the sounds around\
    \ us, but also to include those parts of our personal soundscape that are augmented\
    \ by technology, by the addition of the cellphone to our acoustic world.\n\nThere\
    \ are two distinct audio elements. The first is a “bed” created by an ambient\
    \ microphone. This recording is regeneratively looped at intervals that coincide\
    \ directly to the timings of Cage’s original score. Changes are injected in key\
    \ parameters of the “looping” to perturb and rearrange the material already captured\
    \ in the previous section.\n\nThe second element is the “cellphone opera” score\
    \ that takes input from participants and redistributes the audio material from\
    \ the calls to specific slots in a prearranged “score”. Each new call rearranges\
    \ the entire score as the recordings move to a new temporally ordered location\
    \ in the 4 minute and 33 second time frame. “At the beep” participant callers\
    \ are prompted to respond to randomly chosen requests. “Make the sound of a radio\
    \ out of tune” “Tell us about Cage’s 4’33” performance.” “What is your mother’s\
    \ name?” “Did David Tudor like mushrooms?” Each cellphone call will be recorded\
    \ for 4 seconds and 330 milliseconds."

    \ One mode allows each pendaphone to control a large virtual turntable that allows\
