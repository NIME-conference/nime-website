  abstract: 'The Well--Sequenced Synthesizer is a series of sequencers that create
    music in dialog with the user. Through the sequencers'' physical interfaces, users
    can control music theory-based generative algorithms. This series --a work-in-progress-is
    composed by three sequencers at this time. The first one, called The Counterpointer,
    takes a melody input from the user and responds by generating voices based on
    the rules of eighteenth--century counterpoint. The second one is based on a recent
    treatise on harmony and counterpoint by music theorist Dmitri Tymoczco: El Ordenador
    lets users explore a set of features of tonality by constraining randomly generated
    music according to one or more of them. El Ordenador gives the user less control
    than The Counterpointer, but more than La Mec{\''a}nica, the third sequencer in
    the series. La Mec{\''a}nica plays back the sequences generated by El Ordenador
    using a punch-card reading music box mechanism. It makes the digital patterns
    visible and tactile, and links them back to the physical world.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes the technologies, collaborative processes, and artistic
    intents of the musical composition Engravings for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and
    Computer, which was composed by Timothy Polashek for percussionist Brad Meyer
    using a jointly created electroacoustic and interactive musical instrument. During
    performance, the percussionist equally manipulates and expresses through two surfaces,
    an iPad displaying an interactive touch screen and a snare drum augmented with
    various foreign objects, including a contact microphone adhered to the drumhead''s
    surface. A computer program created for this composition runs on a laptop computer
    in front of the percussionist. The software captures sound from the contact microphone
    and transforms this sound through audio signal processing controlled by the performer''s
    gestures on the iPad. The computer screen displays an animated graphic score,
    as well as the current states of iPad controls and audio signal processing, for
    the performer. Many compositional and technological approaches used in this project
    pay tribute to composer John Cage, since the premiere performance of Engravings
    for Prepared Snare Drum, iPad, and Computer took place in 2012, the centennial
    celebration of Cage''s birth year.'

    This paper proposes a new approach in classification of such works and focuses

  abstract: 'In our current era, where smartphones are commonplace and buzzwords like
    ``the internet of things,'''' ``wearable tech,'''' and ``augmented reality''''
    are ubiquitous, translating performance gestures into data and intuitively mapping
    it to control musical/visual parameters in the realm of computing should be trivial;
    but it isn''t. Technical barriers still persist that limit this activity to exclusive
    groups capable of learning skillsets far removed from one''s musical craft. These
    skills include programming, soldering, microprocessors, wireless protocols, and
    circuit design. Those of us whose creative activity is centered in NIME have to
    become polyglots of many disciplines to achieve our work. In the NIME community,
    it''s unclear that we should even draw distinctions between ''artist'' and ''technician'',
    because these skillsets have become integral to our creative practice. However,
    what about the vast communities of musicians, composers, and artists who want
    to leverage sensing to take their craft into new territory with no background
    in circuits, soldering, embedded programming, and sensor function? eMersion, a
    plug-and-play, modular, wireless alternative solution for creating NIMEs will
    be presented. It enables one to bypass the technical hurdles listed above in favor
    of immediate experimentation with musical practice and wireless sensing. A unique
    software architecture will also be unveiled that enables one to quickly and intuitively
    process and map unpredictable numbers and types of wireless data streams, the

  abstract: 'Pop music jamming on the keyboard requires massive music knowledge. Musician
    needs to understand and memorize the behavior of each chord in different keys.
    However, most simple pop music follows a common chord progression pattern. This
    pattern applies to most simple pop music on all the 12 keys. We designed an app
    that can reduce the difficulty of music jamming on the keyboard by using this
    pattern. The app displays the current chord in the Roman numeral and suggests
    the expected next chord in an easy to understand way on a smartphone. This work
    investigates into the human computer interaction perspective of music performance.
    We use a smartphone app as a bridge, which assists musician to react faster in
    music jamming by transforming the complex music knowledge into a simple, unified
    and easy to understand format. Experiment result shows that this app can help
    the non-keyboardist musician to learn pop music jamming. It also shows that the
    app is useful to assist keyboardist in making key transpose and playing music
    in the key with many sharps and flats. We will use the same interface design to
    guide user on playing other chord progressions such as the jazz chord progression.'

    mixing desk, the author''s Feedback Joypad, and microphone-loudspeaker feedback.
    Links are suggested between the sonic affordances of each instrument and the dynamical
    mechanisms embedded in them. This is discussed in the context of contemporary,

    where elements such as unpredictability and instability are often of interest,
    and the process of exploration and discovery is an important part of the practice.
    Links are also made with the use of dynamical interactions in computer games to
    produce situations in which slight variations in the timing and ordering of inputs
    can lead to very different outcomes, encouraging similarly explorative approaches.'

    might influence the way in which people experience music. We introduce the concept
    of a "robotic musical companion" (RMC) in the form of Shimi, a smart-phone enabled
    five degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic platform. We discuss experiences individuals
    tend to have with music as consumers and performers and explore how these experiences
    can be modified, aided, or improved by the inherent synergies between a human
    and robot. An overview of several applications developed for Shimi is provided.
    These applications place Shimi in various roles and enable human-robotic interactions
    (HRIs) that are highlighted by more personable social communications using natural
    language and other forms of communication.'

  abstract: 'In this paper we propose an empirical method to develop mapping strategies
    between a gestural based interface (the Gloves) and physically based sound synthesis
    models. An experiment was performed in order to investigate which kind of gestures
    listeners associate to synthesised sounds produced using physical models, corresponding
    to three categories of sound: sustained, iterative and impulsive. The results
    of the experiment show that listeners perform similar gestures when controlling
    sounds from the different categories. We used such gestures in order to create
    the mapping strategy between the Gloves and the physically based synthesis engine.'

  abstract: 'CollideFx is a real-time audio effects processor that integrates the
    physics of real objects into the parameter space of the signal chain. Much like
    a traditional signal chain, the user can choose a series of effects and offer
    realtime control to their various parameters. In this work, we introduce a means
    of creating tree-like signal graphs that dynamically change their routing in response
    to changes in the location of the unit generators in a virtual space. Signals
    are rerouted using a crossfading scheme that avoids the harsh clicks and pops
    associated with amplitude discontinuities. The unit generators are easily controllable
    using a click and drag interface that responds using familiar physics. CollideFx
    brings the interactivity of a video game together with the purpose of creating
    interesting and complex audio effects. With little difficulty, users can craft
    custom effects, or alternatively, can fling a unit generator into a cluster of
    several others to obtain more surprising results, letting the physics engine do
    the decision making.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, the authors introduce a stand-alone synthesizer, ``B.O.M.B.
    -Beat Of Magic Box --'''' for electronic music sessions and live performances.
    ``B.O.M.B.'''' has a wireless communication system that synchronizes musical scale
    and tempo (BPM) between multiple devices. In addition, participants can change
    master/slave role between performers immediately. Our primary motivation is to
    provide musicians and nonmusicians with opportunities to experience a collaborative
    electronic music performance. Here, the hardware and interaction design of the
    device is presented. To date, numerous collaborative musical instruments have
    been developed in electronic music field [1][2][3]. The authors are interested
    in formations of musical sessions using stand-alone devices and leader/follower
    relationship in musical sessions. The authors specify three important requirements
    of instrument design for musical session. They are as follows: (1) Simple Interface:
    Interface that enables performers to control three sound elements (pitch, timbre,
    and amplitude) with simple interaction. (2) Portable Stand-alone System: System
    that runs standalone (with sound generators, speakers, and butteries). Because
    musical sessions can be improvised at any place and time, the authors consider
    that portability is essential in designing musical instruments for sessions. (3)
    Wireless Synchronization: System that supports ensembles by automatically synchronizing
    tempo (BPM) and tonality between multiple devices by air because of portability.
    In addition, performers can switch master/slave roles smoothly such as leader/follower
    relationship during a musical session. The authors gave ten live performances
    using this device at domestic and international events. In these events, the authors
    confirmed that our proposed wireless synchronization system worked stable. It
    is suggested that our system demonstrate the practicality of wireless synchronization.
    In future, the authors will evaluate the device in terms of its stability in multi-performer
    musical sessions.'

  abstract: 'For the electric guitar, which takes a large proportion in modern pop
    music, effects unit (or effector) is no longer optional. Many guitarists already
    `play'' their effects with their instrument. However, it is not easy to control
    these effects during the play, so lots of new controllers and interfaces have
    been devised; one example is a pedal type effects that helps players to control
    effects with a foot while their hands are busy. Some players put a controller
    on their guitars. However, our instruments are so precious to drill a hole, and
    the stage is too big for the player who is just kneeling behind the pedals and
    turning the knobs. In this paper, we designed a new control system for electric
    guitar and bass. This paper is about a gesture-based sound control system that
    controls the electric guitar effects (like delay time, reverberation or pitch)
    with the player''s hand gesture. This system utilizes TAPIR signal to trace player''s
    hand motion. TAPIR signal is an acoustic signal that can rarely be received by
    most people, because its frequency exists between 18 kHz to 22 kHz [TAPIR article].
    This system consists of a signal generator, an electric guitar and a sound processor.
    From the generator that is attached on the player''s hand, the TAPIR signal transfers
    to the magnetic pickup equipped on the electric guitar. Player''s gesture is captured
    as a Doppler shift and the processor calculates the value as the sound effect
    parameter. In this paper, we focused on the demonstration of the signal transfer
    on aforementioned system.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents a method for a self-tuning procedure for musical
    robots capable of continuous pitch-shifting. Such a technique is useful for robots
    consisting of many strings: the ability to self-tune allows for long-term installation
    without human intervention as well as on-the-fly tuning scheme changes. The presented
    method consists of comparing a detuned string''s pitch at runtime to a pre-compiled
    table of string responses at varying tensions. The behavior of the current detuned
    string is interpolated from the two nearest pre-characterized neighbors, and the
    desired virtual fret positions are added to the interpolated model. This method
    allows for rapid tuning at runtime, requiring only a single string actuation to
    determine the pitch. After a detailed description of the self-tuning technique
    and implementation, the results will be evaluated on the new Swivel 2 robotic
    slide guitar. The paper concludes with a discussion of performance applications

  abstract: 'Real-time audio analysis has great potential for being used to create
    musically responsive applications in live performances. There have been many examples
    of such use, including sound-responsive visualisations, adaptive audio effects
    and machine musicianship. However, at present, using audio analysis algorithms
    in live performance requires either some detailed knowledge about the algorithms
    themselves, or programming or both. Those wishing to use audio analysis in live
    performances may not have either of these as their strengths. Rather, they may
    instead wish to focus upon systems that respond to audio analysis data, such as
    visual projections or sound generators. In response, this paper introduces the
    Sound Analyser an audio plug-in allowing users to a) select a custom set of audio
    analyses to be performed in real-time and b) send that information via OSC so
    that it can easily be used by other systems to develop responsive applications
    for live performances and installations. A description of the system architecture
    and audio analysis algorithms implemented in the plug-in is presented before moving
    on to two case studies where the plug-in has been used in the field with artists.'

  abstract: 'The term ''gesture'' has represented a buzzword in the NIME community
    since the beginning of its conference series. But how often is it actually used,
    what is it used to describe, and how does its usage here differ from its usage
    in other fields of study? This paper presents a linguistic analysis of the motion-related
    terminology used in all of the papers published in the NIME conference proceedings
    to date (2001-2013). The results show that ''gesture'' is in fact used in 62 %
    of all NIME papers, which is a significantly higher percentage than in other music
    conferences (ICMC and SMC), and much more frequently than it is used in the HCI
    and biomechanics communities. The results from a collocation analysis support
    the claim that ''gesture'' is used broadly in the NIME community, and indicate
    that it ranges from the description of concrete human motion and system control
    to quite metaphorical applications.'

  abstract: 'We present a framework for imitation of percussion performances with
    parameter-based learning for accurate reproduction. We constructed a robotic setup
    involving pull-solenoids attached to drum sticks which communicate with a computer
    through an Arduino microcontroller. The imitation framework allows for parameter
    adaptation to different mechanical constructions by learning the capabilities
    of the overall system being used. For the rhythmic vocabulary, we have considered
    regular stroke, flam and drag styles. A learning and calibration system was developed
    to efficiently perform grace notes for the drag rudiment as well as the single
    stroke and the flam rudiment. A second pre-performance process is introduced to
    minimize the latency difference between individual drum sticks in our mechanical
    setup. We also developed an off-line onset detection method to reliably recognize
    onsets from the microphone input. Once these pre-performance steps are taken,
    our setup will then listen to a human drummer''s performance pattern, analyze
    for onsets, loudness, and rudiment pattern, and then play back using the learned
    parameters for the particular system. We conducted three different evaluations

  abstract: 'In the recent years many touch screen interfaces have been designed and
    used for musical control. When compared with their physical counterparts, current
    control paradigms employed in touch screen musical interfaces do not require the
    same level of physical labor and this negatively affects the user experience in
    terms of expressivity, engagement and enjoyment. This lack of physicality can
    be remedied by using interaction elements, which are designed for the exertion
    of the user. Employing intentionally difficult and inefficient interaction design
    can enhance the user experience by allowing greater bodily expression, kinesthetic
    feedback, more apparent skill acquisition, and performer satisfaction. Rub Synth
    is a touch screen musical instrument with an exertion interface. It was made for
    creating and testing exertion strategies that are possible by only using 2d touch
    coordinates as input and evaluating the outcomes of implementing intentional difficulty.
    This paper discusses the strategies that can be employed to model effort on touch
    screens, the benefits of having physical difficulty, Rub Synth''s interaction
    design, and user experience results of using such an interface.'

  abstract: 'This paper explores the concept of end-user programming languages in
    music composition, and introduces the Manhattan system, which integrates formulas
    with a grid-based style of music sequencer. Following the paradigm of spreadsheets,
    an established model of end-user programming, Manhattan is designed to bridge
    the gap between traditional music editing methods (such as MIDI sequencing and
    typesetting) and generative and algorithmic music -seeking both to reduce the
    learning threshold of programming and support flexible integration of static and
    dynamic musical elements in a single work. Interaction draws on rudimentary knowledge
    of mathematics and spreadsheets to augment the sequencer notation with programming
    concepts such as expressions, built-in functions, variables, pointers and arrays,
    iteration (for loops), branching (goto), and conditional statements (if-then-else).
    In contrast to other programming tools, formulas emphasise the visibility of musical
    data (e.g. notes), rather than code, but also allow composers to interact with
    notated music from a more abstract perspective of musical processes. To illustrate
    the function and use cases of the system, several examples of traditional and
    generative music are provided, the latter drawing on minimalism (process-based
    music) as an accessible introduction to algorithmic composition. Throughout, the
    system and approach are evaluated using the cognitive dimensions of notations
    framework, together with early feedback for use by artists.'

  abstract: 'We present the FingerSynth, a wearable musical instrument made up of
    a bracelet and set of rings that enable its player to produce sound by touching
    nearly any surface in their environment. Each ring contains a small, independently
    controlled exciter transducer commonly used for auditory bone conduction. The
    rings sound loudly when they touch a hard object, and are practically silent otherwise.
    When a wearer touches their own (or someone else''s) head, the contacted person
    hears the sound through bone conduction, inaudible to others. The bracelet contains
    a microcontroller, a set of FET transistors, an accelerometer, and a battery.
    The microcontroller generates a separate audio signal for each ring, switched
    through the FETs, and can take user input through the accelerometer in the form
    of taps, flicks, and other gestures. The player controls the envelope and timbre
    of the sound by varying the physical pressure and the angle of their finger on
    the surface, or by touching differently resonant surfaces. Because its sound is
    shaped by direct, physical contact with objects and people, the FingerSynth encourages
    players to experiment with the materials around them and with one another, making
    music with everything they touch.'

    Automated music performance is a form of music production using programmed musical

    we focus on the music production aspects and describe a method that realizes operation

    distribution of the action (i.e., variation of parameters) is obtained within
    the music, using Bayesian filters. The probability distribution of each piece
    of music is transformed by passing through a Markov model. After the probability
    distribution is obtained, sound parameters can be automatically controlled. We
    have developed a system to reproduce the musical expressions of humans and confirmed
    the possibilities of our method.'

  abstract: 'Wireless technology is growing increasingly prevalent in the development
    of new interfaces for live music performance. However, with a number of different
    wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band, there is a high risk of interference
    and congestion, which has the potential to severely disrupt live performances.
    With its high transmission power, channel bandwidth and throughput, Wi-Fi (IEEE
    802.11) presents an opportunity for highly robust wireless communications. This
    paper presents our preliminary work optimising the components of a Wi-Fi system
    for live performance scenarios. We summarise the manufacture and testing of a
    prototype directional antenna that is designed to maximise sensitivity to a performer''s
    signal while suppressing interference from elsewhere. We also propose a set of
    recommended Wi-Fi configurations to reduce latency and increase throughput. Practical
    investigations utilising these arrangements demonstrate a single x-OSC device
    achieving a latency of <3 ms and a distributed network of 15 devices achieving
    a net throughput of ~4800 packets per second (~320 per device); where each packet
    is a 104-byte OSC message containing 16 analogue input channels acquired by the
    device.'

  abstract: 'This paper explores the challenge of achieving nuanced control and physical
    engagement with gestural interfaces in performance. Performances with a prototype
    gestural performance system, Gestate, provide the basis for insights into the
    application of gestural systems in live contexts. These reflections stem from
    a performer''s perspective, outlining the experience of prototyping and performing
    with augmented instruments that extend vocal or instrumental technique through
    ancillary gestures. Successful implementation of rapidly evolving gestural technologies
    in real-time performance calls for new approaches to performing and musicianship,
    centred around a growing understanding of the body''s physical and creative potential.
    For musicians hoping to incorporate gestural control seamlessly into their performance
    practice a balance of technical mastery and kinaesthetic awareness is needed to
    adapt existing systems to their own purposes. Within non-tactile systems, visual
    feedback mechanisms can support this process by providing explicit visual cues
    that compensate for the absence of haptic or tangible feedback. Experience gained
    through prototyping and performance can yield a deeper understanding of the broader
    nature of gestural control and the way in which performers inhabit their own bodies.'

  abstract: 'The Chimaera is a touch-less, expressive, polyphonic and electronic music
    controller based on magnetic field sensing. An array of hall-effect sensors and
    their vicinity make up a continuous 2D interaction space. The sensors are excited
    with Neodymium magnets worn on fingers. The device continuously tracks position
    and vicinity of multiple present magnets along the sensor array to produce event
    signals accordingly. Apart from the two positional signals, an event also carries
    the magnetic field polarization, a unique identifier and group association. We
    like to think of it as a mixed analog/digital offspring of theremin and trautonium.
    These general-purpose event signals are transmitted and eventually translated
    into musical events according to custom mappings on a host system. With its touch-less
    control (no friction), high update rates (2-4kHz), its quasi-continuous spatial
    resolution and its low-latency (<1 ms), the Chimaera can react to most subtle
    motions instantaneously and allows for a highly dynamic and expressive play. Its
    open source design additionally gives the user all possibilities to further tune
    hardware and firmware to his or her needs. The Chimaera is network-oriented and
    configured with and communicated by OSC (Open Sound Control), which makes it straight-forward
    to integrate into any setup.'

  abstract: 'This paper introduces the OWL stage effects pedal and aims to present
    the device within the context of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research. The
    OWL is a dedicated, programmable audio device designed to provide an alternative
    to the use of laptop computers for bespoke audio processing on stage for music
    performance. By creating a software framework that allows the user to program
    their own code for the hardware in C++, the OWL project makes it possible to use
    homemade audio processing on stage without the need for a laptop running a computer
    music environment such as Pure Data or Supercollider. Moving away from the general-purpose
    computer to a dedicated audio device means that some of the potential problems
    and technical complexity of performing with a laptop computer onstage can be avoided,
    allowing the user to focus more of their attention on the musical performance.
    Within the format of a traditional guitar ''stomp box'', the OWL aims to integrate
    seamlessly into a guitarist''s existing pedal board setup, and in this way presents
    as an example of a ubiquitous and tangible computing device -a programmable computer
    designed to fit into an existing mode of musical performance whilst being transparent

  abstract: 'In this paper we describe the application of a movement-based design
    process for digital musical instruments which led to the development of a prototype
    DMI named the Twister. The development is described in two parts. Firstly, we
    consider the design of the interface or physical controller. Following this we
    describe the development of a specific sonic character, mapping approach and performance.
    In both these parts an explicit consideration of the type of movement we would
    like the device to engender in performance drove the design choices. By considering
    these two parts separately we draw attention to two different levels at which
    movement might be considered in the design of DMIs; at a general level of ranges
    of movement in the creation of the controller and a more specific, but still quite
    open, level in the creation of the final instrument and a particular performance.
    In light of the results of this process the limitations of existing representations
    of movement within the DMI design discourse is discussed. Further, the utility
    of a movement focused design approach is discussed.'

  abstract: 'Conceiving digital musical instruments might be challenging in terms
    of spectator accessibility. Depending on the interface and the complexity of the
    software used as a transition between the controller and sound, a musician performance
    can be totally opaque for the audience and loose its interest. This paper examines
    the possibility of adding a visual feedback to help the public understanding,
    and add expressivity to the performance. It explores the various mapping organizations
    between controller and sound, giving different spaces of representation for the
    visual feedback. It can be either an amplification of the controller parameters,
    or a representation of the related musical parameters. Different examples of visualization
    are presented and evaluated, taking the Cantor Digitalis as a support. It appears
    the representation of musical parameters, little used compared to the representation

  abstract: 'This paper investigates the process of appropriation in digital musical
    instrument performance, examining the effect of instrument complexity on the emergence

    constrained musical instrument, a wooden cube containing a touch/force sensor,
    speaker and embedded computer. Each cube was identical in construction, but half
    the instruments were configured for two degrees of freedom while the other half
    allowed only a single degree. Each musician practiced at home and presented two
    performances, in which their techniques and reactions were assessed through video,
    sensor data logs, questionnaires and interviews. Results show that the addition
    of a second degree of freedom had the counterintuitive effect of reducing the
    exploration of the instrument''s affordances; this suggested the presence of a
    dominant constraint in one of the two configurations which strongly differentiated

  abstract: 'Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have difficulties establishing themselves
    after their creation. A huge number of DMIs is presented every year and few of
    them actually remain in use. Several causes could explain this reality, among
    them the lack of a proper instrumental technique, inadequacy of the traditional
    musical notation and the non-existence of a repertoire dedicated to the instrument.
    In this paper we present Entoa, the first written music for Intonaspacio, a DMI
    we designed in our research project. We propose some strategies for mapping data
    from sensors to sound processing, in order to accomplish an expressive performance.
    Entoa is divided in five different sections that corresponds to five movements.
    For each, a different mapping is designed, introducing subtle alterations that
    progressively explore the ensemble of features of the instrument. The performer
    is then required to adapt his repertoire of gestures along the piece. Indications
    are expressed through a gestural notation, where freedom is give to performer
    to control certain parameters at specific moments in the music.'

  abstract: 'This paper outlines a theoretical framework for creative technology based
    on two contrasting processes: divergent exploration and convergent optimisation.
    We claim that these two cases require different gesture-to-parameter mapping properties.
    Results are presented from a user experiment that motivates this theory. The experiment
    was conducted using a publicly available iPad app: ``Sonic Zoom''''. Participants
    were encouraged to conduct an open ended exploration of synthesis timbre using
    a combination of two different interfaces. The first was a standard interface
    with ten sliders, hypothesised to be suited to the ``convergent'''' stage of creation.
    The second was a mapping of the entire 10-D combinatorial space to a 2-D surface
    using a space filling curve. This novel interface was intended to support the
    ``divergent'''' aspect of creativity. The paths of around 250 users through both
    2-D and 10-D space were logged and analysed. Both the interaction data and questionnaire
    results show that the different interfaces tended to be used for different aspects
    of sound creation, and a combination of these two navigation styles was deemed
    to be more useful than either individually. The study indicates that the predictable,
    separate parameters found in most music technology are more appropriate for convergent

    the potential of direct neural-emotional manipulation in live performance. The
    EEG of the vocalist and one audience member is measured throughout the performance
    and the system generates a real-time score based on mapping the emotional features

    within EEG and map the two-dimensional correlate of averaged windows to musical
    phrases. These pre-composed phrases contain associated emotional content based
    on the KTH Performance Rules System (Director Musices). The piece is in three
    movements, the first two are led by the emotions of each subject respectively,
    whilst the third movement interpolates the combined response of the performer
    and audience member. The system not only aims to reflect the individuals'' emotional
    states but also attempts to induce a shared emotional experience by drawing the

  abstract: 'The algorave movement has received reasonable international exposure
    in the last two years, including a series of concerts in Europe and beyond, and
    press coverage in a number of media. This paper seeks to illuminate some of the
    historical precedents to the scene, its primary aesthetic goals, and the divergent
    technological and musical approaches of representative participants. We keep in
    mind the novel possibilities in musical expression explored by algoravers. The
    scene is by no means homogeneous, and the very lack of uniformity of technique,
    from new live coding languages through code DJing to plug-in combination, with
    or without visual extension, is indicative of the flexibility of computers themselves
    as general information processors.'

  abstract: 'In this paper we describe an artistic response to a collection of natural
    history museum artefacts, developed as part of a residency organised around a
    public participatory workshop. Drawing on a critical literature in studies of
    material culture, the work incorporated data sonification, image audification,
    field recordings and created a number of instruments for exploring geological
    artefacts and meterological data as aesthetic material. The residency culminated
    in an exhibition presented as a ''sensorium'' for the sensory exploration of museum
    objects. In describing the methods and thinking behind the project this paper
    presents an alternative approach to engaging artists and audiences with local
    heritage and museum archives, which draws on research in NIME and allied literatures,
    and which is devoted to enlivening collections as occasions for varied interpretation,
    appropriation and aesthetic response.'

  abstract: 'Physical computing platforms such as the Arduino have significantly simplified
    developing physical musical interfaces. However, those platforms typically target
    everyday programmers rather than composers and media artists. On the other hand,
    tangible user interface (TUI) toolkits, which provide an integrated, easy-to-use
    solution have not gained momentum in modern music creation. We propose a concept
    that hybridizes physical computing and TUI toolkit approaches. This helps to tackle
    typical TUI toolkit weaknesses, namely quick sensor obsolescence and limited choices.
    We developed a physical realization based on the idea of "universal pins", which
    can be configured to perform a variety of duties, making it possible to connect
    different sensor breakouts and modules. We evaluated our prototype by making performance
    measurements and conducting a user study demonstrating the feasibility of our
    approach.'

    morphing system is used to transform live input captured at each sculpture with
    a discrete microphone array, by morphing towards noisy source signals that have
    been associated with each sculpture as part of a pre-determined musical structure.
    The resulting morphed audio is then fed-back to the gallery via a five-channel
    speaker array. Visitors are encouraged to walk freely through the installation

  abstract: 'Acoustic feedback controllers (AFCs) are typically applied to solve feedback
    problems evident in applications such as public address (PA) systems, hearing

    such as musical performance, sound installations, and product design, presents
    a unique insight into the research of embodied sonic interfaces and environments.
    This paper presents techniques that use digital acoustic feedback control algorithms
    to augment the sonic properties of environments and discusses approaches to the
    design of sonically playful experiences that apply such techniques. Three experimental
    prototypes are described to illustrate how the techniques can be applied to versatile
    environments and continuous coupling of users'' audible actions with sonically
    augmented environments. The knowledge obtained from these prototypes has led to
    Acoustic Feedback Ecology System (AFES) design patterns. The paper concludes with

    potentially useful applications ranging from musical performance to everyday contexts.'

  abstract: 'According to the tradition, music ensembles are usually lead by a conductor
    who is the responsible to coordinate and guide the group under a specific musical

    Achieving integration and coherence in a networked performance, however, can be
    challenging in certain scenarios. This is the case for configurations with a high

    design strategies for developing a software based conductor assistant for collective

    as a data medium, a digital data network among the audience and performer can
    be easily built with microphones and speakers, without requiring any additional
    hardware. ``TAPIR Sound Tag'''' is a smart device framework for inaudible data
    communication that can be easily embedded in audience participatory performances
    and interactive arts. With a bandwidth of 900 Hz, a high transmission rate of

    communication among smart devices. This system can be used without any advanced
    knowledge in signal processing and communication system theory; simply specifying
    carrier frequency and bandwidth with a few lines of code can start data communication.
    Several usage scenarios of the system are also presented, such as participating
    in an interactive performance by adding and controlling sound, and collaborative
    completion of an artist''s work by audience. We expect this framework to provide

  abstract: 'Many musical interfaces have used the musical conductor metaphor, allowing
    users to control the expressive aspects of a performance by imitating the gestures
    of conductors. In most of them, the rules to control these expressive aspects
    are predefined and users have to adapt to them. Other works have studied conductors''
    gestures in relation to the performance of the orchestra. The goal of this study
    is to analyze, following the path initiated by this latter kind of works, how
    simple motion capture descriptors can explain the relationship between the loudness
    of a given performance and the way in which different subjects move when asked
    to impersonate the conductor of that performance. Twenty-five subjects were asked
    to impersonate the conductor of three classical music fragments while listening
    to them. The results of different linear regression models with motion capture
    descriptors as explanatory variables show that, by studying how descriptors correlate
    to loudness differently among subjects, different tendencies can be found and
    exploited to design models that better adjust to their expectations.'

    on an extended peg solitaire board as a generator of live musical composition.
    The classic puzzle game, for one person, is extended by mapping the moves of the
    game through a self contained system using Arduino and Raspberry Pi, triggering
    both analogue and digital sound. The solitaire board, as instrument, is presented
    as a wood and Perspex box with the hardware inside. Ball bearings function as
    both solitaire pegs and switches, while a purpose built solenoid controlled monochord
    and ball bearing run provide the analogue sound source, which is digitally manipulated
    in real-time, according to the sequences of game moves. The creative intention

  abstract: 'We introduce and describe the initial evaluation of a new low-cost augmented
    violin prototype, with research focused on the user experience when playing such
    hybrid physical-digital instruments, and the exploration of novel interactive
    performance techniques. Another goal of this work is wider platform accessibility
    for players, via a simple `do-it-yourself'' approach described by the design herein.
    While the hardware and software elements are open source, the build process can
    nonetheless require non-insignificant investments of time and money, as well as
    basic electronics construction skills. These have been kept to a minimum wherever
    possible. Our initial prototype is based upon an inexpensive electric violin that
    is widely available online for approximately $200 USD. This serves as the starting
    point for construction, to which the design adds local Digital Signal Processing
    (DSP), gestural sensing, and sound output. Real-time DSP algorithms are running
    on a mobile device, which also incorporates orientation/gesture sensors for parameter
    mapping, with the resulting sound amplified and rendered via small loudspeakers
    mounted on the instrument. The platform combines all necessary elements for digitally-mediated
    interactive performance; the need for a traditional computer only arises when
    developing new DSP algorithms for the platform. An initial exploratory evaluation
    with users is presented, in which performers explore different possibilities with
    the proposed platform (various DSP implementations, mapping schemes, physical
    setups, etc.) in order to better establish the needs of the performing artist.
    Based on these results, future work is outlined leading towards the development
    of a complete quartet of instruments.'

    aim of the studies was to investigate the perceived similarity and the efficacy
    of two multidimensional mappings each consisting of three audio-visual associations.
    The purpose of the mappings is to enable visual control of corpus-based concatenative
    synthesis. More specifically the stimuli in the first study was designed to test
    the perceived similarity of six audio-visual associations, between the two mappings
    using three corpora resulting in 18 audio-visual stimuli. The corpora differ in
    terms of two sound characteristics: harmonic contain and continuity. Data analysis
    revealed no significant differences in the participant''s responses between the
    three corpora, or between the two mappings. However highly significant differences
    were revealed between the individual audio-visual association pairs. The second
    study investigates the affects of the mapping and the corpus in the ability of
    the participants to detect which image out of three similar images was used to
    generate six audio stimuli. The data analysis revealed significant differences
    in the ability of the participants'' to detect the correct image depending on
    which corpus was used. Less significant was the effect of the mapping in the success

    the world of music on the same terms as normal functioning people. Musical instruments
    have been refined the last centuries which makes them highly specialized instruments
    that nearly all requires at least two functioning hands. In this study we try
    to enable people with hemiplegia to play a real electrical guitar by modifying
    it in a way that make people with hemiplegia able to actually play the guitar.
    We developed the guitar platform to utilize sensors to capture the rhythmic motion
    of alternative fully functioning limbs, such as a foot, knee or the head to activate
    a motorized fader moving a pick back and forth across the strings. The approach
    employs the flexibility of a programmable digital system which allows us to scale
    and map different ranges of data from various sensors to the motion of the actuator
    and thereby making it easier adapt to individual users. To validate and test the
    instrument platform we collaborated with the Helena Elsass Center during their
    2013 Summer Camp to see if we actually succeeded in creating an electrical guitar
    that children with hemiplegia could actually play. The initial user studies showed

    play. The rhythmic patterns can be manipulated by modifying the environment of

    embodied cognition is that biological behavior can only be understood through
    an understanding of the real-time interactions of an organism''s nervous system,
    the organism''s body and the environment. One the one hand the device illustrates
    this theory because the patterns that are created equally depend on the real-time
    interactions of the electronics, the physical structure of the device and the
    environment. On the other hand the device presents a synthesis of these ideas

  abstract: 'Music plays a vital role in accompanying all manner of our experiences.
    Soundtracks within films, video games and ceremonies possess a unique ability
    to enhance a narrative, suggest emotional content and mark key transitions. Moreover,
    soundtracks often achieve all of this without being the primary focus, on the
    contrary they typically assume a supporting role. The proliferation of mobile
    devices increasingly leads us to listen to music while on the move and musicians
    are seizing on locative technologies as a tool for creating new kinds of music
    that directly respond to people''s movements through space. In light of these
    trends, we consider the interesting question of how composers might set about
    creating musical soundtracks to accompany mobile experiences. What we have in
    mind are experiences such as guided walks, tours and even pervasive games. The
    novelty of our research here is in the music serving as an accompaniment to enhance
    a location specific activity, much as a soundtrack does for a film. This calls
    for composers to take into account the key features of the experience, and its
    setting, to gently complement them through the music. We examine this process
    from a composer''s perspective by presenting `from the field'' an account of how
    they address the multifaceted challenges of designing a soundtrack for public
    sculpture park. We chart a composer''s rationale as they developed a soundtrack
    for this site over multiple iterations of design, testing and refinement. We expose
    key relationships between the raw materials of music (melody, harmony, timbre,
    rhythm and dynamics) and those of the physical setting, that enable the composer
    to gracefully mesh the music into the fabric of the space. The result is to propose
    a set of recommendations to inform the composition of mobile soundtracks that
    we intend to guide future practice and research.'

    We survey other augmented piano projects, several of which focus on gestural recognition,

    and estimation of gesture variations in real-time. Our implementation uses the
    Kinect depth sensor to track body motion in space, which is used as input data.
    During an initial learning phase, the system is taught a set of reference gestures,
    or templates. During performance, the live gesture is classified in real-time,
    and variations with respect to the recognized template are computed. These values
    can then be mapped to audio processing parameters, to control digital effects
    which are applied to the acoustic output of the piano in real-time. We discuss
    initial tests using PiaF with a pianist, as well as potential applications beyond

  abstract: 'Motion sensing technologies enable musical interfaces where a performer
    moves their body "in the air" without manipulating or contacting a physical object.
    These interfaces work well when the movement and sound are smooth and continuous,
    but it has proven difficult to design a system which triggers discrete sounds
    with precision that allows for complex rhythmic performance. We conducted a study
    where participants perform ``air-drumming'''' gestures in time to rhythmic sounds.
    These movements are recorded, and the timing of various movement features with
    respect to the onset of audio events is analyzed. A novel algorithm for detecting
    sudden changes in direction is used to find the end of the strike gesture. We
    find that these occur on average after the audio onset and that this timing varies
    with the tempo of the movement. Sharp peaks in magnitude acceleration occur before
    the audio onset and do not vary with tempo. These results suggest that detecting
    peaks in acceleration will lead to more naturally responsive air gesture instruments.'

  abstract: 'Sketching is a natural way for one person to convey their thoughts and
    intentions to another. With the recent rise of tablet-based computing, the use
    of sketching as a control and interaction paradigm is one that deserves exploration.
    In this paper we present an interactive sketch-based music composition and performance
    system called Drawchestra. The aim of the system is to give users an intuitive
    way to convey their musical ideas to a computer system with the minimum of technical
    training thus enabling them to focus on the creative tasks of composition and
    performance. The system provides the user with a canvas upon which they may create
    their own instruments by sketching shapes on the tablet screen. The system recognises
    a certain set of shapes which it treats as virtual instruments or effects. Once
    recognised, these virtual instruments can then be played by the user in real time.
    The size of a sketched instrument shape is used to control certain parameters
    of the sound so the user can build complex orchestras containing many different
    shapes of different sizes. The sketched shapes may also be moved and resized as
    desired making it possible to customise and edit the virtual orchestra as the
    user goes along. The system has been implemented in Python and user tests conducted
    using an iPad as the control surface. We report the results of the user study
    at the end of the paper before briefly discussing the outcome and outlining the
    next steps for the system design.'

    the purposes of this research a laptop ensemble is defined as a performing group
    of three or more musicians for whom the laptop is the main sound generating source
    and who typically perform together in the same room. The concept of democracy
    (i.e. governance by members of the group) has been used as a starting point to
    assess firstly what types of organisational structures are currently used in laptop
    ensembles and secondarily to what extent laptop ensembles consider the implications
    of organisational and social structure on their musical output. To assess this
    I recorded a number of data points including ensemble size, whether the group
    has a director or conductor, use of homogenous vs. heterogenous hardware and software,
    whether they perform composed pieces or mainly improvise, the level of network
    interaction and whether or not the ensemble has an academic affiliation. The survey
    allowed me to define a scale of democracy in laptop ensembles and typical features
    of the most and least democratic groups. Some examples are given of democratic
    and autocratic activity in existing laptop ensembles. This work is part of a larger

  abstract: 'What do new possibilities for music and art making look like in a world
    in which the biological and mechanical are increasingly entangled? Can a contrived

    It was with these questions in mind that the interactive mechanical sound art
    installation endo/exo came into being. Through the use of networked technology
    the system becomes more like a self-aware organism, passing messages from node
    to node as cells communicate through chemical signals with their neighbors. In
    an artistic context, the communication network resembles, but differs from, other
    mechanical systems. Issues such as latency are often considered negative factors,
    yet they can contribute a touch of personality in this context. This paper is
    a reflection on these and other considerations gained from the experience of designing
    and constructing endo/exo as well as future implications for the Honeycomb platform
    as a tool for creating musical interactions within a new paradigm which allows
    for emergent behavior across vast physical spaces. The use of swarming and self-organization,
    as well as playful interaction, creates an ``aliveness'''' in the mechanism, and

  abstract: 'This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings, design, and development

    an electric guitar. The system combines a multichannel audio feed from the guitar
    (which is parsed for its pitch, spectral content and note inter--onset time data
    to provide abstractions of sounded performance gestures) with motion tracking
    of the performer''s larger--scale bodily movements using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect
    sensor. These gestural materials are used to provide the basis for the structures
    of relational mappings, informed by the embodied image schema structures of Lakoff
    and Johnson. These theoretical perspectives are refined via larger-scale ecological-embodied

    of spectromorphology, alongside the incorporation of an additional active-agential
    response structure through the use of the boids flocking algorithm by Reynolds

    aims to advance a broadly-applicable ''performance gesture ecology'', providing

    to run in the Pure Data dataflow environment. Several use cases were explored,
    focusing on addressing current issues in mapping research. ESNs were found to
    work successfully in scenarios of pattern classification, multiparametric control,
    explorative mapping and the design of nonlinearities and uncontrol. \emph{Un-trained}
    behaviours are proposed, as augmentations to the conventional reservoir system
    that allow the player to introduce potentially interesting non-linearities and
    uncontrol into the reservoir. Interactive evolution style controls are proposed
    as strategies to help design these behaviours, which are otherwise dependent on
    arbitrary parameters. A study on sound classification shows that ESNs can reliably
    differentiate between two drum sounds, and also generalise to other similar input.
    Following evaluation of the use cases, heuristics are proposed to aid the use

  abstract: 'Audiences of live laptop music frequently express dismay at the opacity
    of performer activity and question how ``live'''' performances actually are. Yet
    motionless laptop performers endure as musical spectacles from clubs to concert
    halls, suggesting that for many this is a non-issue. Understanding these perceptions
    might help performers better achieve their intentions, inform interface design
    within the NIME field and help develop theories of liveness and performance. To
    this end, a study of listeners'' perception of liveness and performer control
    in laptop performance was carried out, in which listeners examined several short
    audio-only excerpts of laptop performances and answered questions about their
    perception of the performance: what they thought was happening and its sense of
    liveness. Our results suggest that audiences are likely to associate liveness
    with perceived performer activity such as improvisation and the audibility of
    gestures, whereas perceptions of generative material, backing tracks, or other
    preconceived material do not appear to inhibit perceptions of liveness.'

  abstract: 'One problem with live computer music performance is the transport of
    computers to a venue and the following setup of the computers used in playing
    and rendering music. The more computers involved the longer the setup and tear-down
    of a performance. Each computer adds power and cabling requirements that the venue
    must accommodate. Cloud computing can change of all this by simplifying the setup
    of many (10s, 100s) of machines at the click of a button. But there''s a catch,
    the cloud is not physically near you, you cannot run an audio cable to the cloud.
    The audio from a computer music instrument in the cloud needs to streamed back
    to the performer and listeners. There are many solutions for streaming audio over
    networks and the internet, most of them suffer from high latency, heavy buffering,
    or proprietary/non-portable clients. In this paper we propose a portable cloud-friendly
    method of streaming, almost a cloud soundcard, whereby performers can use mobile
    devices (Android, iOS, laptops) to stream audio from the cloud with far lower
    latency than technologies like icecast. This technology enables near-realtime
    control over power computer music networks enabling performers to travel light
    and perform live with more computers than ever before.'

    musical expression, and although eye-tracking devices have become increasingly
    cost-effective and prevalent in research and as a means of communication for people
    with severe motor impairments, eye-controlled musical expression nonetheless remains
    somewhat elusive and minimally explored. This paper (a) identifies a number of
    fundamental human eye movement capabilities and constraints which determine in
    part what can and cannot be musically expressed with eye movements, (b) reviews
    prior work on eye-controlled musical expression, and (c) analyzes and provides
    a taxonomy of what has been done, and what will need to be addressed in future
    eye-controlled musical instruments. The fundamental human constraints and processes
    that govern eye movements create a challenge for eye-controlled music in that
    the instrument needs to be designed to motivate or at least permit specific unique
    visual goals, each of which when accomplished must then be mapped, using the eye
    tracker and some sort of sound generator, to different musical outcomes. The control
    of the musical instrument is less direct than if it were played with muscles that
    can be controlled in a more direct manner, such as the muscles in the hands.'

  abstract: 'The Feedback Cello is a new electroacoustic actuated instrument in which
    feedback can be induced independently on each string. Built from retro-fitted
    acoustic cellos, the signals from electromagnetic pickups sitting under each string
    are passed to a speaker built into the back of the instrument and to transducers
    clamped in varying places across the instrument body.  Placement of acoustic and
    mechanical actuators on the resonant body of the cello mean that this simple analogue
    feedback system is capable of a wide range of complex self-resonating behaviours.
    This paper describes the motivations for building these instruments as both a
    physical extension to live coding practice and an electroacoustic augmentation
    of cello. The design and physical construction is outlined, and modes of performance
    described with reference to the first six months of performances and installations.
    Future developments and planned investigations are outlined.'

  abstract: 'We introduce a family of fragile electronic musical instruments designed
    to be "played" through the act of destruction. Each Fragile Instrument consists
    of an analog synthesizing circuit with embedded sensors that detect the destruction
    of an outer shell, which is destroyed and replaced for each performance. Destruction
    plays an integral role in both the spectacle and the generated sounds.  This paper
    presents several variations of Fragile Instruments we have created, discussing
    their circuit design as well as choices of material for the outer shell and tools
    of destruction. We conclude by considering other approaches to create intentionally

  abstract: 'Learning to play the transverse flute is not an easy task, at least not
    for everyone.  Since the flute does not have a reed to resonate, the player must
    provide a steady, focused stream of air that will cause the flute to resonate
    and thereby produce sound.  In order to achieve this, the player has to be aware
    of the embouchure position to generate an adequate air jet.  For a beginner, this
    can be a difficult task due to the lack of visual cues or indicators of the air
    jet and lips position.  This paper attempts to address this problem by presenting
    an augmented flute that can make the gestures related to the embouchure visible
    and measurable.  The augmented flute shows information about the area covered
    by the lower lip, estimates the lip hole shape based on noise analysis, and it
    shows graphically the air jet direction.  Additionally, the augmented flute provides
    directional and continuous feedback in real time, based on data acquired by experienced
    flutists.'

  abstract: 'This paper explores the idea of using virtual textural terrains as a
    means of generating haptic profiles for force-feedback controllers. This approach
    breaks from the paradigm established within audio-haptic research over the last
    few decades where physical models within virtual environments are designed to
    transduce gesture into sonic output.  We outline a method for generating multimodal
    terrains using basis functions, which are rendered into monochromatic visual representations
    for inspection. This visual terrain is traversed using a haptic controller, the
    NovInt Falcon, which in turn receives force information based on the grayscale
    value of its location in this virtual space. As the image is traversed by a performer
    the levels of resistance vary, and the image is realized as a physical terrain.
    We discuss the potential of this approach to afford engaging musical experiences
    for both the performer and the audience as iterated through numerous performances.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents solutions to improve reliability and to work around
    challenges of using a Leap Motion; sensor as a gestural control and input device
    in digital music instrument (DMI) design. We implement supervised learning algorithms
    (k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, binary decision tree, and artificial
    neural network) to estimate hand motion data, which is not typically captured
    by the sensor. Two problems are addressed: 1) the sensor cannot detect overlapping
    hands 2) The sensor''s limited detection range. Training examples included 7 kinds
    of overlapping hand gestures as well as hand trajectories where a hand goes out
    of the sensor''s range. The overlapping gestures were treated as a classification
    problem and the best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with 62% accuracy.
    The out-of-range problem was treated first as a clustering problem to group the
    training examples into a small number of trajectory types, then as a classification
    problem to predict trajectory type based on the hand''s motion before going out
    of range. The best performing model was k-nearest neighbors with an accuracy of
    30%. The prediction models were implemented in an ongoing multimedia electroacoustic

    (such as an architectural Design, a performance or social experiment). One other
    relevant aspect was that Digital technology was used in the design and fabrication
    of the physical instruments'' prototypes, but in very few cases, it was used in

    exclusively in acoustic and mechanical sound.  '

  abstract: 'Musicians, audio engineers and producers often make use of common timbral
    adjectives to describe musical signals and transformations. However, the subjective
    nature of these terms, and the variability with respect to musical context often
    leads to inconsistencies in their definition. In this study, a model is proposed
    for controlling an equaliser by navigating clusters of datapoints, which represent
    grouped parameter settings with the same timbral description. The interface allows
    users to identify the nearest cluster to their current parameter setting and recommends
    changes based on its relationship to a cluster centroid. To do this, we apply
    dimensionality reduction to a dataset of equaliser curves described as warm and
    bright using a stacked autoencoder, then group the entries using an agglomerative
    clustering algorithm with a coherence based distance criterion. To test the efficacy
    of the system, we implement listening tests and show that subjects are able to
    match datapoints to their respective sub-representations with 93.75% mean accuracy.'

  abstract: 'Biostomp is a new musical interface that relies on the use mechanomyography
    (MMG) as a biocontrol mechanism in live performance situations.  Designed in the
    form of a stomp box, Biostomp translates a performer''s muscle movements into
    control signals. A custom MMG sensor captures the acoustic output of muscle tissue
    oscillations resulting from contractions. An analog circuit amplifies and filters
    these signals, and a micro-controller translates the processed signals into pulses.
    These pulses are used to activate a stepper motor mechanism, which is designed
    to be mounted on parameter knobs on effects pedals.  The primary goal in designing
    Biostomp is to offer a robust, inexpensive, and easy-to-operate platform for integrating
    biological signals into both traditional and contemporary music performance practices
    without requiring an intermediary computer software. In this paper, we discuss
    the design, implementation and evaluation of Biostomp. Following an overview of
    related work on the use of biological signals in artistic projects, we offer a
    discussion of our approach to conceptualizing and fabricating a biocontrol mechanism
    as a new musical interface. We then discuss the results of an evaluation study

    position (straightness of the spine and rotation of the pelvis) deviation from

    Microsoft Kinect v2.  The movement of the student is mirrored through an abstract
    skeletal figure and instructions are provided through a virtual teacher.  Posture
    deviation is measured in the following way: Torso misalignment is calculated by
    comparing hip center joint, shoulder center joint and neck joint position with
    an ideal posture position retrieved in an initial calibration procedure. Pelvis
    deviation is expressed as the xz-rotation of the hip-center joint. The posture
    deviation is sonified via a varying cut-off frequency of a high-pass filter applied
    to floating water sound. The posture deviation is visualized via a curve and a
    rigged skeleton in which the misaligned torso parts are color-coded. In an experiment
    with 9-12 year-old dance students from a ballet school, comparing the audio-visual

  abstract: 'A new hybrid approach to digital keyboard playing is presented, where
    the actual acoustic sounds from a digital keyboard are captured with contact microphones
    and applied as excitation signals to a digital model of a prepared piano, i.e.,
    an extended wave-guide model of strings with the possibility of stopping and muting
    the strings at arbitrary positions. The parameters of the string model are controlled
    through TouchKeys multitouch sensors on each key, combined with MIDI data and
    acoustic signals from the digital keyboard frame, using a novel mapping.  The
    instrument is evaluated from a performing musician''s perspective, and emerging
    playing techniques are discussed. Since the instrument is a hybrid acoustic-digital
    system with several feedback paths between the domains, it provides for expressive
    and dynamic playing, with qualities approaching that of an acoustic instrument,
    yet with new kinds of control.  The contributions are two-fold. First, the use
    of acoustic sounds from a physical keyboard for excitations and resonances results
    in a novel hybrid keyboard instrument in itself. Second, the digital model of

    to incarnate the different roles of a whole rhythm section by looping rhythms,
    chord progressions, bassline and more. The loop pedal, is still the most used
    device for those types of performances, accounting for many of the cover songs
    performances on youtube, but not all kinds of song apply.  Unlike a common loop
    pedal, each layer of sound in RL is produced by an intelligent looping-agent which
    adapts to the musician and respects given constraints, using constrained optimization.  In
    its original form, RL worked well for jazz guitar improvisation but was unsuited
    to structured music such as pop songs. In order to bring the system on pop stage,
    we revisited the system interaction, following the guidelines of professional
    users who tested it extensively. We describe the revisited system which can accommodate
    both pop and jazz. Thanks to intuitive pedal interaction and structure-constraints,

  abstract: 'Physical modelling is a sophisticated synthesis technique, often used
    in the design of Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs). Some of the most precise
    physical simulations of sound propagation are based on Finite-Difference Time-Domain
    (FDTD) methods, which are stable, highly parameterizable but characterized by
    an extremely heavy computational load. This drawback hinders the spread of FDTD
    from the domain of off-line simulations to the one of DMIs. With this paper, we
    present a novel approach to real-time physical modelling synthesis, which implements
    a 2D FDTD solver as a shader program running on the GPU directly within the graphics
    pipeline. The result is a system capable of running fully interactive, massively
    sized simulation domains, suitable for novel DMI design. With the help of diagrams
    and code snippets, we provide the implementation details of a first interactive
    application, a drum head simulator whose source code is available online. Finally,
    we evaluate the proposed system, showing how this new approach can work as a valuable

    We augment a physical theremin with 3D visual cues to indicate correct hand positioning
    for performing given notes and volumes.  The physical theremin acts as a domain
    specific controller for the resulting MR environment.  The initial effectiveness
    of this approach is measured by analyzing a performer''s hand position while training

    \ afforded by interactive digital technologies.  Building on Paul Lansky's vision\

    continue their evolution and actively take part in the history of music is partially
    attributed to the existing compositions made specifically for them, pieces that
    remain and are still played over a long period of time. This is something we know,
    performing these compositions keeps the characteristics of the instruments alive
    and able to survive. This paper presents our contribution to this discussion with
    a context and historical background for idiomatic compositions. Looking beyond
    the classical era, we discuss how the concept of idiomatic music has influenced
    research and composition practices in the NIME community; drawing more attention
    in the way current idiomatic composition practices considered specific NIME affordances
    for sonic, social and spatial interaction. We present particular projects that
    establish idiomatic writing as a part of a new repertoire for new musical instruments.
    The idiomatic writing approach to composing music for NIME can shift the unique

  abstract: 'Gestural interfaces, which make use of physiological signals, hand /
    body postures or movements, have become widespread for musical expression.  While
    they may increase the transparency and expressiveness of instruments, they may
    also result in limited agency, for musicians as well as for spectators. This problem
    becomes especially true when the implemented mappings between gesture and music
    are subtle or complex. These instruments may also restrict the appropriation possibilities
    of controls, by comparison to physical interfaces.  Most existing solutions to
    these issues are based on distant and/or limited visual feedback (LEDs, small
    screens).  Our approach is to augment the gestures themselves with revealed virtual
    objects.  Our contributions are, first a novel approach of visual feedback that
    allow for additional expressiveness, second a software pipeline for pixel-level
    feedback and control that ensures tight coupling between sound and visuals, and
    third, a design space for extending gestural control using revealed interfaces.
    We also demonstrate and evaluate our approach with the augmentation of three existing

  abstract: 'This paper presents a knowledge-based, data-driven method for using data
    describing action-sound couplings collected from a group of people to generate
    multiple complex mappings between the performance movements of a musician and
    sound synthesis.  This is done by using a database of multimodal motion data collected
    from multiple subjects coupled with sound synthesis parameters.  A series of sound
    stimuli is synthesised using the sound engine that will be used in performance.
    Multimodal motion data is collected by asking each participant to listen to each
    sound stimulus and move as if they were producing the sound using a musical instrument
    they are given.  Multimodal data is recorded during each performance, and paired
    with the synthesis parameters used for generating the sound stimulus.  The dataset
    created using this method is then used to build a topological representation of
    the performance movements of the subjects. This representation is then used to
    interactively generate training data for machine learning algorithms, and define
    mappings for real-time performance.  To better illustrate each step of the procedure,
    we describe an implementation involving clarinet, motion capture, wearable sensor
    armbands, and waveguide synthesis.'

  abstract: 'An important part of electronic dance music (EDM) is the so-called beat.  It
    is defined by the drum track of the piece and is a style defining element.  While
    producing EDM, creating the drum track tends to be delicate, yet labor intensive
    work.  In this work we present a touch-interface-based prototype with the goal
    to simplify this task.  The prototype aims at supporting musicians to create rhythmic
    patterns in the context of EDM production and live performances.  Starting with
    a seed pattern which is provided by the user, a list of variations with varying
    degree of deviation from the seed pattern is generated.  The interface provides
    simple ways to enter, edit, visualize and browse through the patterns.  Variations
    are generated by means of an artificial neural network which is trained on a database
    of drum rhythm patterns extracted from a commercial drum loop library.  To evaluate
    the user interface and pattern generation quality a user study with experts in
    EDM production was conducted.  It was found that participants responded positively
    to the user interface and the quality of the generated patterns.  Furthermore,
    the experts consider the prototype helpful for both studio production situations
    and live performances.'

  abstract: 'Music listening has changed greatly with the emergence of music streaming
    services, such as Spotify or YouTube. In this paper, we discuss an artistic practice
    that organizes streaming videos to perform a real-time improvisation via live
    coding. A live coder uses any available video from YouTube, a video streaming
    service, as source material to perform an improvised audiovisual piece. The challenge
    is to manipulate the emerging media that are streamed from a networked service.
    The musical gesture can be limited due to the provided functionalities of the
    YouTube API. However, the potential sonic and visual space that a musician can
    explore is practically infinite. The practice embraces the juxtaposition of manipulating
    emerging media in old-fashioned ways similar to experimental musicians in the
    60''s physically manipulating tape loops or scratching vinyl records on a phonograph
    while exploring the possibility of doing so by drawing on the gigantic repository
    of all kinds of videos. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of using streaming

  abstract: 'The JoyStyx Quartet is a series of four embedded acoustic instruments.
    Each of these instruments is a five-voice granular synthesizer which processes
    a different sound source to give each a unique timbre and range. The performer
    interacts with these voices individually with five joysticks positioned to lay
    under the performer''s fingertips.  The JoyStyx uses a custom-designed printed
    circuit board. This board provides the joystick layout and connects them to an
    Arduino Micro, which serializes the ten analog X/Y position values and the five
    digital button presses. This data controls the granular and spatial parameters
    of a Pure Data patch running on a Raspberry Pi 2.  The nature of the JoyStyx construction
    causes the frequency response to be coloured by the materials and their geometry,
    leading to a unique timbre. This endows the instrument with a more ``analog''''
    or ``natural'''' sound, despite relying on computer-based algorithms. In concert,
    the quartet performance with the JoyStyx may potentially be the first performance
    ever with a quartet of Embedded Acoustic Instruments.'

    Indeed, Miranda has coined the term Brain-computer Musical Interface (BCMI) to
    refer to this category. There are no "plug-n-play" solutions for a BCMI, these
    kinds of tools usually require the setup and implementation of particular software
    configurations, customized for each EEG device. The Emotiv Insight is a low-cost
    EEG apparatus that outputs several kinds of data, such as EEG rhythms or facial
    expressions, from the user''s brain activity. We have developed a BCMI, in the
    form of a freely available middle-ware, using the Emotiv Insight for EEG input
    and signal processing. The obtained data, via blue-tooth is broad-casted over
    the network formatted for the OSC protocol. Using this software, we tested the
    device''s adequacy as a BCMI by using the provided data in order to control different
    sound synthesis algorithms in MaxMSP. We conclude that the Emotiv Insight is an
    interesting choice for a BCMI due to its low-cost and ease of use, but we also

  abstract: 'This paper presents the results of a study of piano pedalling techniques
    on the sustain pedal using a newly designed measurement system named Piano Pedaller.
    The system is comprised of an optical sensor mounted in the piano pedal bearing
    block and an embedded platform for recording audio and sensor data.  This enables
    recording the pedalling gesture of real players and the piano sound under normal
    playing conditions. Using the gesture data collected from the system, the task
    of classifying these data by pedalling technique was undertaken using a Support
    Vector Machine (SVM). Results can be visualised in an audio based score following
    application to show pedalling together with the player''s position in the score.'

  abstract: 'While most musical robots that are capable of playing the drum kit utilise
    a relatively simple striking motion, the hi-hat, with the additional degree of
    motion provided by its pedal, requires more involved control strategies in order
    to produce expressive performances on the instrument. A robotic hi-hat should
    be able to control not only the striking timing and velocity to a high degree
    of precision, but also dynamically control the position of the two cymbals in
    a way that is consistent, reproducible and intuitive for composers and other musicians
    to use.  This paper describes the creation of a new, multifaceted hi-hat control
    system that utilises a closed-loop distance sensing and calibration mechanism
    in conjunction with an embedded musical information retrieval system to continuously
    calibrate the hi-hat''s action both before and during a musical performance. This
    is achieved by combining existing musical robotic devices with a newly created
    linear actuation mechanism, custom amplification, acquisition and DSP hardware,
    and embedded software algorithms.  This new approach allows musicians to create
    expressive and reproducible musical performances with the instrument using consistent
    musical parameters, and the self-calibrating nature of the instrument lets users
    focus on creating music instead of maintaining equipment. '

    and find creative ways to make live improvised music on stage. The constraints
    are applied in two forms: i) Physically implemented on the instruments themselves,
    and ii) hidden rules that are defined on a network between the instruments and
    triggered depending on the musical actions of the performers. Six experienced
    musicians were recruited for a user study which involved rehearsal and performance.
    Performers were given deliberately constrained instruments containing a touch
    sensor, speaker, battery and an embedded computer. Results of the study show that
    whilst constraints can lead to more structured improvisation, the resultant music
    may not fit with performers'' true intentions. It was also found that when external

    it is likely to be ignored because it was perceived by performers as being out

    with the original design of guitar effect pedals. The classic foot activated effect

    This paper presents a new design that enables the performer to interact with the

    the activation of the effect at any location on the stage. The usability of the
    device has been tested on thirty experienced guitar players. Their performance

    underpinnings, as well as the technical means required to achieve a particular
    result.  DJster, the engine we used for the generative processes is based on Clarence
    Barlow''s probabilistic algorithms. Equipped with the proper periphery (sensors,
    sound modules and spatializers), we looked at three different scenarios, each
    requiring specific musical and technological solutions. The pilot was concluded
    by a symposium in 2017 and the development of a prototype system. The symposium
    yielded a diagram detailing the circular dynamic of the factors involved in this
    particular project, while the prototype was demoed in 2016 at the HfMT facilities.

  abstract: 'The need for thorough evaluations is an emerging area of interest and
    importance in music interaction research. As a large degree of DMI evaluation
    is concerned with exploring the subjective experience: ergonomics, action-sound
    mappings and control intimacy; User Experience (UX) methods are increasingly being
    utilised to analyse an individual''s experience of new musical instruments, from
    which we can extract meaningful, robust findings and subsequently generalised
    and useful recommendations. However, many music interaction evaluations remain
    informal. In this paper, we provide a meta-review of 132 papers from the 2014
    -- 2016 proceedings of the NIME, SMC and ICMC conferences to collate the aspects
    of UX research that are already present in music interaction literature, and to
    highlight methods from UX''s widening field of research that have not yet been
    explored. Our findings show that usability and aesthetics are the primary focus
    of evaluations in music interaction research, and other important components of
    the user experience such as enchantment, motivation and frustration are frequently
    if not always overlooked. We argue that these factors are prime areas for future
    research in the field and their consideration in design and evaluation could lead
    to a better understanding of NIMEs and other computer music technology.'

    and reflect upon the sounds of the instruments it is performed in collaboration
    with. At its core, it samples an input audio signal and allows the performer to
    replay these samples through a granular resynthesizer. Normally the Fragment String
    samples an acoustic instrument that accompanies it, but in the absence of this
    input it will amplify the ambient environment and electronic noise of the input
    audio path to audible levels and sample these. This ability to leverage both structural,
    tonal sound and unstructured noise provide the instrument with multiple dimensions
    of musical expressivity. The relative magnitude of the physical gestures required
    to manipulate the instrument and control the sound also engage an audience in
    its performance. This straightforward yet expressive design has lent the Fragment
    String to a variety of performance techniques and settings. These are explored
    through case studies in a five year history of Fragment String-based compositions
    and performances, illustrating the strengths and limitations of these interactions

    Using traditional lutherie as a model, we conducted a series of interviews to
    explore how violin makers ``go beyond the obvious'''', and how players perceive
    and describe subtle details of instrumental quality. We find that lutherie frameworks
    provide clear design methods and have substantial empirical backing, but are not
    enough to make a fine violin. Success comes after acquiring sufficient tacit knowledge,
    which enables detailed craft through subjective, empirical methods. Testing instruments
    for subtle qualities was suggested to be a different skill to playing. Whilst
    players are able to identify some specific details about instrumental quality
    by comparison, these are often not actionable, and important aspects of ``sound

  abstract: 'This paper presents the next stage of an investigation into the potential
    of historical theatre sound effects as a resource for Sonic Interaction Design
    (SID). An acoustic theatre wind machine was constructed, and a digital physical
    modelling-based version of this specific machine was programmed using the Sound
    Designer''s Toolkit (SDT) in Max/MSP. The acoustic wind machine was fitted with
    3D printed gearing to mechanically drive an optical encoder and control the digital
    synthesis engine in real time. The design of this system was informed by an initial
    comparison between the acoustic wind machine and the first iteration of its digital
    counterpart. To explore the main acoustic parameters and the sonic range of the
    acoustic and digital wind machines in operation, three simple and distinct rotational
    gestures were performed, with the resulting sounds recorded simultaneously, facilitating
    an analysis of the real-time performance of both sources. The results are reported,
    with an outline of future work. '

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a discussion of the development of hardware
    systems in collaboration with professional artists, a context which presents both
    challenges and opportunities for researchers interested in the uses of technology
    in artistic practice. The establishment of design specifications within these
    contexts can be challenging, especially as they are likely to change during the
    development process. In order to assist in the consideration of the complete set
    of design specifications, we identify seven aspects of hardware design relevant
    to our applications: function, aesthetics, support for artistic creation, system
    architecture, manufacturing, robustness, and reusability.  Examples drawn from
    our previous work are used to illustrate the characteristics of interdependency
    and temporality, and form the basis of case studies investigating support for
    artistic creation and reusability. We argue that the consideration of these design
    aspects at appropriate times within the development process may facilitate the
    ability of hardware systems to support continued use in professional applications.'

  abstract: 'Many musical instruments exhibit an inherent latency or delayed auditory
    feedback (DAF) between actuator activation and the occurrence of sound.  We investigated
    how DAF (73ms and 250ms) affects musically trained (MT) and non-musically trained
    (NMT) people''s ability to synchronize the audible strum of an actuated guitar
    to a metronome at 60bpm and 120bpm. The long DAF matched a subdivision of the
    overall tempo. We compared their performance using two different input devices
    with feedback before or on activation. While 250ms DAF hardly affected musically
    trained participants, non-musically trained participants'' performance declined

  abstract: 'New digital musical instruments are difficult for organologists to deal
    with, due to their heterogeneous origins, interdisciplinary science, and fluid,
    open-ended nature. NIMEs are studied from a range of disciplines, such as musicology,
    engineering, human-computer interaction, psychology, design, and performance studies.
    Attempts to continue traditional organology classifications for electronic and
    digital instruments have been made, but with unsatisfactory results. This paper
    raises the problem of tree-like classifications of digital instruments, proposing
    an alternative approach: musical organics .  Musical organics is a philosophical
    attempt to tackle the problems inherent in the organological classification of
    digital instruments. Shifting the emphasis from hand-coded classification to information
    retrieval supported search and clustering, an open and distributed system that
    anyone can contribute to is proposed. In order to show how such a system could
    incorporate third-party additions, the paper also presents an organological ontogenesis
    of three innovative musical instruments: the saxophone, the Minimoog, and the
    Reactable.  This micro-analysis of innovation in the field of musical instruments
    can help forming a framework for the study of how instruments are adopted in musical

  abstract: 'This paper is about a novel robotic guitar that establishes shared control
    between human performers and mechanical actuators.  Unlike other mechatronic guitar
    instruments that perform pre-programmed music automatically, this guitar allows
    the human and actuators to produce sounds jointly; there exists a distributed
    control between the human and robotic components. The interaction allows human
    performers to have full control over the melodic, harmonic, and expressive elements
    of the instrument while mechanical actuators excite and dampen the string with
    a rhythmic pattern.  Guitarists can still access the fretboard without the physical
    interference of a mechatronic system, so they can play melodies and chords as
    well as perform bends, slides, vibrato, and other expressive techniques. Leveraging
    the capabilities of mechanical actuators, the mechanized hammers can output complex
    rhythms and speeds not attainable by humans. Furthermore, the rhythmic patterns
    can be algorithmically or stochastically generated by the hammer, which supports
    real-time interactive improvising.'

    targets high-end multi-channel audio processing and synthesis with very low latency
    and power consumption. The microcontroller has a rich set of audio and communication
    peripherals, capable of performing complex real-time DSP tasks with double precision
    floating point accuracy.  This demonstration will showcase specific features of
    the Stride language, which facilitates the design of new interactive musical instruments.
    The Stride IDE will be used to compose Stride code and generate code for the Saturn
    M7 board.  The various hardware capabilities of the Saturn M7 board will also
    be presented.'

  abstract: 'We present an attachment for the bass guitar which allows MIDI-controlled
    actuated fretting. This adapted instrument is presented as a potential method
    of augmenting the bass guitar for those with upper-limb disabilities. We conducted
    an online survey of 48 bassists in order to highlight the most important aspects
    of bass playing. We found that timbral and dynamic features related to the plucking
    hand were most important to the survey respondents. We designed an actuated fretting
    mechanism to replace the role of the fretting hand in order to preserve plucking
    hand techniques. We then conducted a performance study in which experienced bassists
    prepared and performed an accompaniment to a backing track with the adapted bass.
    The performances highlighted ways in which adapting a fretted string instrument
    in this way impacts plucking hand technique. '

  abstract: 'Musical performers need to show off their virtuosity for selfexpression
    and communicate with other people. Therefore, they are prepared to perform at
    any time and anywhere. However, a musical keyboard of 88 keys is too large and
    too heavy to carry around. When a portable keyboard that is suitable for carrying
    around is played over a wide range, the notes being played frequently cause the
    diapason of the keyboard to protrude. It is common to use Key Transpose in conventional
    portable keyboards, which shifts the diapason of the keyboard. However, this function
    creates several problems such as the feeling of discomfort from the misalignment
    between the keying positions and their output sounds. Therefore, the goal of our
    study is to construct Mobile Clavier, which enables the diapason to be changed
    smoothly. Mobile Clavier resolves the problems with Key Transpose by having black
    keys inserted between any two side-by-side white keys. This paper also discusses
    how effective Mobile Clavier was in an experiment conducted using professional
    pianists. We can play music at any time and anywhere with Mobile Clavier.'

  abstract: 'We describe the prevailing model of musical expression, which assumes
    a binary formulation of "the text" and "the act", along with its implied roles
    of composer and performer. We argue that this model not only excludes some contemporary
    aesthetic values but also limits the communicative ability of new music interfaces.
    As an alternative, an ecology of musical creation accounts for both a diversity
    of aesthetic goals and the complex interrelation of human and non-human agents.
    An ecological perspective on several approaches to musical creation with interactive
    technologies reveals an expanded, more inclusive view of artistic interaction
    that facilitates novel, compelling ways to use technology for music. This paper
    is fundamentally a call to consider the role of aesthetic values in the analysis
    of artistic processes and technologies. '

  abstract: 'Live coding is almost the antithesis of immediate physical musicianship,
    and yet, has attracted the attentions of a number of computer-literate musicians,
    as well as the music-savvy programmers that might be more expected. It is within
    the context of live coding that I seek to explore the question of practising a
    contemporary digital musical instrument, which is often raised as an aside but
    more rarely carried out in research (though see [12]). At what stage of expertise
    are the members of the live coding movement, and what practice regimes might help

  abstract: 'This paper presents two main ideas: (1) Various newly invented liquid-based
    or underwater musical instruments are proposed that function like woodwind instruments
    but use water instead of air. These “woodwater” instruments expand the space of
    known instruments to include all three states of matter: solid (strings, percussion);
    liquid (the proposed instruments); and gas (brass and woodwinds). Instruments
    that use the fourth state of matter (plasma) are also proposed. (2) Although the
    current trend in musical interfaces has been to expand versatililty and generality
    by separating the interface from the sound-producing medium, this paper identifies
    an opposite trend in musical interface design inspired by instruments such as
    the harp, the acoustic or electric guitar, the tin whistle, and the Neanderthal
    flute, that have a directness of user-interface, where the fingers of the musician
    are in direct physical contact with the sound-producing medium. The newly invented
    instruments are thus designed to have this sensually tempting intimacy not be
    lost behind layers of abstraction, while also allowing for the high degree of
    virtuosity. Examples presented include the poseidophone, an instrument made from
    an array of ripple tanks, each tuned for a particular note, and the hydraulophone,
    an instrument in which sound is produced by pressurized hydraulic fluid that is
    in direct physical contact with the fingers of the player. Instruments based on
    these primordial media tend to fall outside existing classifications and taxonomies
    of known musical instruments which only consider instruments that make sound with
    solid or gaseous states of matter. To better understand and contextualize some
    of the new primordial user interfaces, a broader concept of musical instrument
    classification is proposed that considers the states of matter of both the user-interface
    and the sound production medium.'

  abstract: 'Chroma based representations of acoustic phenomenon are representations
    of sound as pitched acoustic energy. A framewise chroma distribution over an entire
    musical piece is a useful and straightforward representation of its musical pitch
    over time. This paper examines a method of condensing the block-wise chroma information
    of a musical piece into a two dimensional embedding. Such an embedding is a representation
    or map of the different pitched energies in a song, and how these energies relate
    to each other in the context of the song. The paper presents an interactive version
    of this representation as an exploratory analytical tool or instrument for granular
    synthesis. Pointing and clicking on the interactive map recreates the acoustical
    energy present in the chroma blocks at that location, providing an effective way
    of both exploring the relationships between sounds in the original piece, and
    recreating a synthesized approximation of these sounds in an instrumental fashion. '

  abstract: 'This paper describes the design and implementation of a new interface
    prototype for live music mixing. The ColorDex system employs a completely new
    operational metaphor which allows the mix DJ to prepare up to six tracks at once,
    and perform mixes between up to three of those at a time. The basic premises of
    the design are: 1) Build a performance tool that multiplies the possible choices
    a DJ has in respect in how and when tracks are prepared and mixed; 2) Design the
    system in such a way that the tool does not overload the performer with unnecessary
    complexity, and 3) Make use of novel technology to make the performance of live
    music mixing more engaging for both the performer and the audience. The core components
    of the system are: A software program to load, visualize and playback digitally
    encoded tracks; the HDDJ device (built chiefly out of a repurposed hard disk drive),
    which provides tactile manipulation of the playback speed and position of tracks;

  abstract: 'A crucial set of decisions in digital musical instrument design deals
    with choosing mappings between parameters controlled by the performer and the
    synthesis algorithms that actually generate sound. Feature-based synthesis offers
    a way to parameterize audio synthesis in terms of the quantifiable perceptual
    characteristics, or features, the performer wishes the sound to take on. Techniques
    for accomplishing such mappings and enabling feature-based synthesis to be performed
    in real time are discussed. An example is given of how a real-time performance

  abstract: 'Playing music over the Internet, whether for real-time jamming, network
    performance or distance education, is constrained by the speed of light which
    introduces, over long distances, time delays unsuitable for musical applications.
    Current musical collaboration systems generally transmit compressed audio streams
    over low-latency and high-bandwidthnetworks to optimize musician synchronization.
    This paperproposes an alternative approach based on pattern recognition and music
    prediction. Trained for a particular typeof music, here the Indian tabla drum,
    the system calledTablaNet identifies rhythmic patterns by recognizing individual
    strokes played by a musician and mapping them dynamically to known musical constructs.
    Symbols representing these musical structures are sent over the network toa corresponding
    computer system. The computer at thereceiving end anticipates incoming events
    by analyzing previous phrases and synthesizes an estimated audio output.Although
    such a system may introduce variants due to prediction approximations, resulting
    in a slightly different musical experience at both ends, we find that it demonstratesa
    high level of playability with an immediacy not present inother systems, and functions
    well as an educational tool.'

    body-to-body communication so that a self image based on the sense of being a
    separate body can be signicant altered through an openness toand even a sense
    of becoming part of another body. FreqtricDrums is a device that turns audiences
    surrounding a performer into drums so that the performer, as a drummer, cancommunicate
    with audience members as if they were a setof drums. We describe our concept and
    the implementationand process of evolution of Freqtric Drums.'

    to develop digital toys for improving children’s social behavior in the future.
    It was further developed as part of the IAMAS-Interface Cultures exchange program.
    “Mountain Guitar” is a new musical instrument that enables musical expression
    through a custom-made sensor technology, which captures and transforms the height
    at which the instrument is held to the musical outcome during the playing session.
    One of the goals of “Mountain Guitar” is to let untrained users easily and intuitively
    play guitar through their body movements. In addition to capturing the users’
    body movements, “Mountain Guitar” also simulates standard guitar playing techniques
    such as vibrato, choking, and mute. “Mountain Guitar’s” goal is to provide playing

  abstract: 'This paper discusses a quantitative method to evaluate whether an expert
    player is able to execute skilled actions on an unfamiliar interface while keeping
    the focus of their performance on the musical outcome rather than on the technology
    itself. In our study, twelve professional electric guitar players used an augmented
    plectrum to replicate prerecorded timbre variations in a set of musical excerpts.
    The task was undertaken in two experimental conditions: a reference condition,
    and a subtle gradual change in the sensitivity of the augmented plectrum which
    is designed to affect the guitarist’s performance without making them consciously
    aware of its effect. We propose that players’ subconscious response to the disruption
    of changing the sensitivity, as well as their overall ability to replicate the
    stimuli, may indicate the strength of the relationship they developed with the
    new interface. The case study presented in this paper highlights the strengths
    and limitations of this method.'

  abstract: 'One of the consequences of the pandemic has been the potential to embrace
    hybrid support for different human group activities, including music performance,
    resulting in accommodating a wider range of situations. We believe that we are
    barely at the tip of the iceberg and that we can explore further the possibilities
    of the medium by promoting a more active role of the audience during telematic
    performance. In this paper, we present personic, a mobile web app designed for
    distributed audiences to constitute a digital musical instrument. This has the
    twofold purpose of letting the audience contribute to the performance with a non-intrusive
    and easy-to-use approach, as well as providing audiovisual feedback that is helpful
    for both the performers and the audience alike. The challenges and possibilities
    of this approach are discussed from pilot testing the app using a practice-based
    approach. We conclude by pointing to new directions of telematic performance,
    which is a promising direction for network music and digital performance.'

  abstract: 'Physical modelling sound synthesis methods generate vast and intricate
    sound spaces that are navigated using meaningful parameters. Numerical based physical
    modelling synthesis methods provide authentic representations of the physics they
    model. Unfortunately, the application of these physical models are often limited
    because of their considerable computational requirements. In previous studies,
    the CPU has been shown to reliably support two-dimensional linear finite-difference
    models in real-time with resolutions up to 64x64. However, the near-ubiquitous
    parallel processing units known as GPUs have previously been used to process considerably
    larger resolutions, as high as 512x512 in real-time. GPU programming requires
    a low-level understanding of the architecture, which often imposes a barrier for
    entry for inexperienced practitioners. Therefore, this paper proposes HyperModels,
    a framework for automating the mapping of linear finite-difference based physical
    modelling synthesis into an optimised parallel form suitable for the GPU. An implementation
    of the design is then used to evaluate the objective performance of the framework
    by comparing the automated solution to manually developed equivalents. For the
    majority of the extensive performance profiling tests, the auto-generated programs
    were observed to perform only 60% slower but in the worst-case scenario it was
    50% slower. The initial results suggests that, in most circumstances, the automation
    provided by the framework avoids the lowlevel expertise required to manually optimise
    the GPU, with only a small reduction in performance. However, there is still scope
    to improve the auto-generated optimisations. When comparing the performance of
    CPU to GPU equivalents, the parallel CPU version supports resolutions of up to
    128x128 whilst the GPU continues to support higher resolutions up to 512x512.
    To conclude the paper, two instruments are developed using HyperModels based on
    established physical model designs.'

    environmental sustainability instances in the practice of circuit bending. This
    proposal combines circuit bending-related concepts with literature from the domain
    of sustainable Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We commence by presenting an
    overview of the critical discourse within the New Interfaces for Musical Expression
    (NIME) community, and of circuit bending itself—exposing the linkages this practice
    has with themes directly related to this research, such as environmental sustainability
    and philosophy. Afterwards, we look at how the topic of environmental sustainability
    has been discussed, concerning circuit bending, within the NIME literature. We
    conclude by developing a list of recommendations for a sustainable circuit bending
    practice.'

  abstract: 'This paper explores a minimalist approach to live coding using a single
    input parameter to manipulate the graph structure of a finite state machine through
    a stream of bits. This constitutes an example of bottom-up live coding, which
    operates on a low level language to generate a high level structure output. Here
    we examine systematically how to apply mappings of continuous gestural interactions
    to develop a bottom-up system for predicting programming behaviours. We conducted
    a statistical analysis based on a controlled data generation procedure. The findings
    concur with the subjective experience of the behavior of the system when the user
    modulates the sampling frequency of a variable clock using a knob as an input
    device. This suggests that a sequential predictive model may be applied towards
    the development of a tactically predictive system according to Tanimoto’s hierarchy
    of liveness. The code is provided in a git repository.'

  abstract: 'Deformable interfaces are an emerging area of Human- Computer Interaction
    (HCI) research that offers nuanced and responsive physical interaction with digital
    technologies. They are well suited to creative and expressive forms of HCI such
    as Digital Musical Interfaces (DMIs). However, research on the design of deformable
    DMIs is limited. This paper explores the role that deformable interfaces might
    play in DMI design. We conducted an online study with 23 DMI designers in which
    they were invited to create non-functional deformable DMIs together. Our results
    suggest forms of gestural input and sound mappings that deformable interfaces
    intuitively lend themselves to for DMI design. From our results, we highlight
    four styles of DMI that deformable interfaces might be most suited to, and suggest
    the kinds of experience that deformable DMIs might be most compelling for musicians
    and audiences. We discuss how DMI designers explore deformable materials and gestures
    input and the role of unexpected affordances in the design process.'

  abstract: 'We present a systematic review of voice-centered NIME publications from
    the past two decades. Musical expression has been a key driver of innovation in
    voicebased technologies, from traditional architectures that amplify singing to
    cutting-edge research in vocal synthesis. NIME conference has emerged as a prime
    venue for innovative vocal interfaces. However, there hasn’t been a systematic
    analysis of all voice-related work or an effort to characterize their features.
    Analyzing trends in Vocal NIMEs can help the community better understand common
    interests, identify uncharted territories, and explore directions for future research.
    We identified a corpus of 98 papers about Vocal NIMEs from 2001 to 2021, which
    we analyzed in 3 ways. First, we automatically extracted latent themes and possible
    categories using natural language processing. Taking inspiration from concepts
    surfaced through this process, we then defined several core dimensions with associated
    descriptors of Vocal NIMEs and assigned each paper relevant descriptors under
    each dimension. Finally, we defined a classification system, which we then used
    to uniquely and more precisely situate each paper on a map, taking into account
    the overall goals of each work. Based on our analyses, we present trends and challenges,
    including questions of gender and diversity in our community, and reflect on opportunities
    for future work.'

  abstract: 'Music technology ensembles—often consisting of multiple laptops as the
    performers’ primary instrument— provide collaborative artistic experiences for
    electronic musicians. In an effort to remove the significant technical and financial
    barriers that laptops can present to performers looking to start their own group,
    this paper proposes a solution in the form of the Norns Shield, a computer music
    instrument (CMI) that requires minimal set-up and promotes immediate music-making
    to performers of all skill levels. Prior research centered on using alternative
    CMIs to supplant laptops in ensemble settings is discussed, and the benefits of
    adopting the Norns Shield in service of democratizing and diversifying the music
    technology ensemble are demonstrated in a discussion centered on the University
    of Texas Rio Grande Valley New Music Ensemble’s adoption of the instrument. A
    description of two software packages developed by the author showcases an extension
    of the instrument’s abilities to share collaborative control data between internet-enabled
    CMIs and to remotely manage script launching and parameter configuration across
    a group of Norns Shields, providing resources for ensembles interested in incorporating

  abstract: 'The On Board Call is a bespoke musical interface designed to engage the
    general public’s interest in wildlife sounds—such as bird, frog or animal calls—through
    imitation and interaction. The device is a handheld, battery-operated, microprocessor-based
    machine that synthesizes sounds using frequency modulation synthesis methods.
    It includes a small amplifier and loudspeaker for playback and employs an accelerometer
    and force sensor that register gestural motions that control sound parameters
    in real time. The device is handmade from off-the-shelf components onto a specially
    designed PCB and laser cut wooden boards. Development versions of the device have
    been tested in wildlife listening contexts and in location-based ensemble performance.
    The device is simple to use, compact and inexpensive to facilitate use in community-based
    active listening workshops intended to enhance user’s appreciation of the eco
    acoustic richness of natural environments. Unlike most of the previous work in
    wildlife call imitation, the Call does not simply play back recorded wildlife
    sounds, it is designed for performative interaction by a user to bring synthesized
    sounds to life and imbue them with expression.'

  abstract: 'An emerging approach to building new musical instruments is based on
    training neural networks to generate audio conditioned upon parametric input.
    We use the term "generative models" rather than "musical instruments" for the
    trained networks because it reflects the statistical way the instruments are trained
    to "model" the association between parameters and the distribution of audio data,
    and because "musical" carries historical baggage as a reference to a restricted
    domain of sound. Generative models are musical instruments in that they produce
    a prescribed range of sound playable through the expressive manipulation of an
    interface. To learn the mapping from interface to audio, generative models require
    large amounts of parametrically labeled audio data. This paper introduces the
    Synthetic Audio Textures (Syn- Tex1) collection of data set generators. SynTex
    is a database of parameterized audio textures and a suite of tools for creating
    and labeling datasets designed for training and testing generative neural networks
    for parametrically conditioned sound synthesis. While there are many existing
    labeled speech and traditional musical instrument databases available for training
    generative models, most datasets of general (e.g. environmental) audio are oriented
    and labeled for the purpose of classification rather than expressive musical generation.
    SynTex is designed to provide an open shareable reference set of audio for creating
    generative sound models including their interfaces. SynTex sound sets are synthetically
    generated. This facilitates dense and accurate labeling necessary for conditionally
    training generative networks conditionally dependent on input parameter values.
    SynTex has several characteristics designed to support a data-centric approach
    to developing, exploring, training, and testing generative models.'

  abstract: 'Ghost Play is a violin-playing robot that aims to realize bowing and
    fingering similar to human players. Existing violin-playing machines have faced
    various problems concerning performance techniques owing to constraints imposed
    by their design. Bowing and fingering that require accurate and high-acceleration
    movement (e.g., a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando) are essential but challenging.
    To overcome this problem, Ghost Play is equipped with seven electromagnetic linear
    actuators, three for controlling the bow (i.e., the right hand), and the other
    four for controlling the pitch on each string (i.e., the left hand). The violin-playing
    robot is mounted with an unmodified violin bow. A sensor is attached to the bow
    to measure bow pressure. The control software receives a time series of performance
    data and manipulates the actuators accordingly. The performance data consists
    of the bow direction, bow speed, bow pressure, pitch, vibrato interval, vibrato
    width, and string to be drawn. We also developed an authoring tool for the performance
    data using a graphic user interface. Finally, we demonstrated Ghost Play performing
    bowing and fingering techniques such as a spiccato, tremolo, and glissando, as
    well as a piece of classical music.'

  abstract: 'Feedback is a technique that has been used in musical performance since
    the advent of electricity. From the early cybernetic explorations of Bebe and
    Louis Barron, through the screaming sound of Hendrix’s guitar, to the systems
    design of David Tudor or Nic Collins, we find the origins of feedback in music
    being technologically and aesthetically diverse. Through interviews with participants
    in a recent Feedback Musicianship Network symposium, this paper seeks to investigate
    the contemporary use of this technique and explore how key protagonists discuss
    the nature of their practice. We see common concepts emerging in these conversations:
    agency, complexity, coupling, play, design and posthumanism. The paper presents
    a terminological and ideological framework as manifested at this point in time,
    and makes a theoretical contribution to the understanding of the rationale and
    potential of this technological and compositional approach.'

  abstract: 'Beginning, amateur, and professional violinists alike make use of a shoulder
    rest with a typical form factor for ergonomic support. Numerous commercial devices
    are available. We saturate these inert devices with electronics and actuators
    to open a new design space for “active shoulder rests” (ASRs), a pathway for violinists
    to adopt inexpensive and transparent electroacoustic interfaces. We present a
    dual-mode ASR that features a built-in microphone pickup and parametric control
    of mixing between sound diffusion and actuation modes for experiments with active
    acoustics and feedback. We document a modular approach to signal processing allowing
    quick adaptation and differentiation of control signals, and demonstrate rich
    sound processing techniques that create lively improvisation environments. By
    fostering participation and convergence among digital media practices and diverse
    musical cultures, we envision ASRs broadly rekindling creative practice for the
    violin, long a tool of improvisation before the triumph of classical works. ASRs
    decolonize the violin by activating new flows and connectivities, freeing up habitual
    relations, and refreshing the musical affordances of this otherwise quintessentially
    western and canonical instrument.'

  abstract: 'Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly being envisaged as a process of
    perceptual mediation or modulation, not only as a system that combines aligned
    and interactive virtual objects with a real environment. Within artistic practice,
    this reconceptualisation has led to a medium that emphasises this multisensory
    integration of virtual processes, leading to expressive, narrative-driven, and
    thought-provoking AR experiences. This paper outlines the development and evaluation
    of the polaris~ experience. polaris~ is built using a set of open-source hardware
    and software components that can be used to create privacy-respecting and cost-effective
    audiovisual AR experiences. Its wearable component is comprised of the open-source
    Project North Star AR headset and a pair of bone conduction headphones, providing
    simultaneous real and virtual visual and auditory elements. These elements are
    spatially aligned using Unity and PureData to the real space that they appear
    in and can be gesturally interacted with in a way that fosters artistic and musical
    expression. In order to evaluate the polaris~, 10 participants were recruited,
    who spent approximately 30 minutes each in the AR scene and were interviewed about
    their experience. Using grounded theory, the author extracted coded remarks from
    the transcriptions of these studies, that were then sorted into the categories
    of Sentiment, Learning, Adoption, Expression, and Immersion. In evaluating polaris~
    it was found that the experience engaged participants fruitfully, with many noting
    their ability to express themselves audiovisually in creative ways. The experience
    and the framework the author used to create it is available in a Github respository.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents the MappEMG pipeline. The goal of this pipeline is
    to augment the traditional classical concert experience by giving listeners access,
    through the sense of touch, to an intimate and non-visible dimension of the musicians’
    bodily experience while performing. The live-stream pipeline produces vibrations
    based on muscle activity captured through surface electromyography (EMG). Therefore,
    MappEMG allows the audience to experience the performer’s muscle effort, an essential
    component of music performance which is typically unavailable to direct visual
    observation. The paper is divided in four sections. First, we overview related
    works on EMG, music performance, and vibrotactile feedback. We then present conceptual
    and methodological issues of capturing musicians’ muscle effort related to their
    expressive intentions. We further explain the different components of the live-stream
    data pipeline: a python software named Biosiglive for data acquisition and processing,
    a Max/MSP patch for data post-processing and mapping, and a mobile application
    named hAPPtiks for real-time control of smartphones’ vibration. Finally, we address
    the application of the pipeline in an actual music performance. Thanks to their
    modular structure, the tools presented could be used in different creative and
    biomedical contexts involving gestural control of haptic stimuli.'

  abstract: 'Physical metaphor provides a visceral and universal logical framework
    for composing musical gestures. Physical simulations can aid composers in creating
    musical gestures based in complex physical metaphors. CHON (Coupled Harmonic Oscillator
    Network) is a new crossplatform application for composing musical gestures based
    in Newtonian physics. It simulates a network of particles connected by springs
    and sonifies the motion of individual particles. CHON is an interactive instrument
    that can provide complex yet tangible and physically grounded control data for
    synthesis, sound processing, and musical score generation. Composers often deploy
    dozens of independent LFOs to control various parameters in a DAW or synthesizer.
    By coupling numerous control signals together using physical principles, CHON
    represents an innovation on the traditional LFO model of musical control. Unlike
    independent LFOs, CHON’s signals push and pull on each other, creating a tangible
    causality in the resulting gestures. In this paper, I briefly describe the design
    of CHON and discuss its use in composition through examples in my own works.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes the development of CAVI, a coadaptive audiovisual
    instrument for collaborative humanmachine improvisation. We created this agent-based
    live processing system to explore how a machine can interact musically based on
    a human performer’s bodily actions. CAVI utilized a generative deep learning model
    that monitored muscle and motion data streamed from a Myo armband worn on the
    performer’s forearm. The generated control signals automated layered time-based
    effects modules and animated a virtual body representing the artificial agent.
    In the final performance, two expert musicians (a guitarist and a drummer) performed
    with CAVI. We discuss the outcome of our artistic exploration, present the scientific
    methods it was based on, and reflect on developing an interactive system that
    is as much an audiovisual composition as an interactive musical instrument.'

  abstract: 'In the context of immersive sonic interaction, Virtual Reality Musical
    Instruments have had the relative majority of attention thus far, fueled by the
    increasing availability of affordable technology. Recent advances in Mixed Reality

    beyond Virtual Reality. In this paper, we explore the taxonomy of Extended Reality
    systems, establishing our own notion of MR. From this, we propose a new classification
    of Virtual Musical Instrument, known as a Mixed Reality Musical Instrument (MRMI).
    We define this system as an embodied interface for expressive musical performance,
    characterized by the relationships between the performer, the virtual, and the
    physical environment. After a review of existing literature concerning the evaluation
    of immersive musical instruments and the affordances of MR systems, we offer a
    new framework based on three dimensions to support the design and analysis of
    MRMIs. We illustrate its use with application to existing works.'

  abstract: 'NIME has recently seen critique emerging around colonisation of music
    technology, and the need to decolonise digital audio workstations and music software.
    While commercial DAWs tend to sideline musical styles outside of western norms
    (and even many inside too), viewing this problem through an historical lens of
    imperialist legacies misses the influence of a more recent - and often invisible
    - hegemony that bears significant direct responsibility: The culture of technological
    development. In this paper we focus on the commercial technological development
    culture that produces these softwares, to better understand the more latent reasons
    why music production software ends up supporting some music practices while failing
    others. By using this lens we can more meaningfully separate the influence of
    historic cultural colonisation and music tech development culture, in order to
    better advocate for and implement meaningful change. We will discuss why the meaning
    of the term “decolonisation” should be carefully examined when addressing the
    limitations of DAWs, because while larger imperialist legacies continue to have
    significant impact on our understanding of culture, this can direct attention
    away from the techno-cultural subset of this hegemony that is actively engaged
    in making the decisions that shape the software we use. We discuss how the conventions
    of this techno-cultural hegemony shape the affordances of major DAWs (and thereby
    musical creativity). We also examine specific factors that impact decision making
    in developing and evolving typical music software alongside latent social structures,
    such as competing commercial demands, how standards are shaped, and the impact
    of those standards. Lastly, we suggest that, while we must continue to discuss
    the impact of imperialist legacies on the way we make music, understanding the
    techno-cultural subset of the colonial hegemony and its motives can create a space
    to advocate for conventions in music software that are more widely inclusive.'

  abstract: 'Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) offer new opportunities for collaboration,
    such as exchanging sounds or sharing controls between musicians. However, in the
    context of spontaneous and heterogeneous orchestras, such as jam sessions, collective
    music-making may become challenging due to the diversity and complexity of the
    DMIs and the musicians’ unfamiliarity with the others’ instruments. In particular,
    the potential lack of visibility into each musician’s respective contribution
    to the sound they hear, i.e. who is playing what, might impede their capacity
    to play together. In this paper, we propose to augment each instrument in a digital
    orchestra with visual feedback extracted in real-time from the instrument’s activity,
    in order to increase this awareness. We present the results of a user study in
    which we investigate the influence of visualisation level and situational visibility
    during short improvisations by groups of three musicians. Our results suggest
    that internal visualisations of all instruments displayed close to each musician’s
    instrument provide the best awareness.'

  abstract: 'The management of the musical structures and the awareness of the performer’s
    processes during a performance are two important aspects of live coding improvisations.
    To support these aspects, we developed and evaluated two systems, Time_X and Time_Z,
    for visualizing the musical form during live coding. Time_X allows visualizing
    an entire performance, while Time_Z provides a detailed overview of the last improvised
    musical events. Following an autobiographical approach, the two systems have been
    used in five sessions by the first author of this paper, who created a diary about
    the experience. These diaries have been analyzed to understand the two systems
    individually and compare them. We finally discuss the main benefits related to
    the practical use of these systems, and possible use scenarios.'

    and digital fabrication to investigate sensory mappings across the visual, auditory,

    in this medium. Specifically, we introduce a custom adapter for the Oculus Touch
    controller that allows it to be augmented with physical parts that can be tracked,
    visualized, and sonified in VR. This way, a VR instrument can be made to have
    a physical manifestation that facilitates additional forms of tactile feedback
    besides those offered by the Touch controller, enabling new forms of musical interaction.
    We then discuss a case study, where we use the adapter to implement a new VR instrument
    that integrates the repelling force between neodymium magnets into the controllers.
    This allows us to imbue the virtual instrument, which is inherently devoid of
    tactility, with haptic feedback—-an essential affordance of many musical instruments.'

  abstract: 'The Web MIDI API allows the Web browser to interact with hardware and
    software MIDI devices detected at the operating system level. This ability for
    the browser to interface with most electronic instruments made in the past 30
    years offers significant opportunities to preserve, enhance or re-discover a rich
    musical and technical heritage. By including MIDI in the broaderWeb ecosystem,
    this API also opens endless possibilities to create music in a networked and socially
    engaging way. However, the Web MIDI API specification only offers low-level access
    to MIDI devices and messages. For instance, it does not provide semantics on top
    of the raw numerical messages exchanged between devices. This is likely to deter
    novice programmers and significantly slow down experienced programmers. After
    reviewing the usability of the bare Web MIDI API, the WEBMIDI. js JavaScript library
    was created to alleviate this situation. By decoding raw MIDI messages, encapsulating
    complicated processes and providing semantically significant objects, properties,
    methods and events, the library makes it easier to interface with MIDI devices
    from compatible browsers. This paper first looks at the context in which the specification
    was created and then discusses the usability improvements layered on top of the
    API by the opensource WEBMIDI.js library.'

    The MRMI probe was experienced by 10 musician participants (mean age: 25.6 years
    [SD=3.0], 6 females, 4 males). We conducted a user evaluation comprising three
    stages. After an experimentation period, participants were asked to accompany
    a pre-recorded piece of music. In a post-task stage, participants took part in
    semi-structured interviews, which were subjected to thematic analysis. Prevalent
    themes included reducing the size of the interface, issues with the field of view
    of the device and physical strain from playing. Participants were largely in favour
    of hand poses as expressive control, although this depended on customisation and
    temporal dynamics; the use of interactive machine learning (IML) for user-adaptive

    of the wearable vibrotactile listening garment and participants’ selfreported

    opportunities and felt experiences of sound and music. All participants reported
    that the listening experience highlighted their first-person experience, focusing
    on their bodies, "regardless of an observer". These findings show how we can improve
    both such an internal experience of the listener and the collaboration potential
    between performers for increased inclusion. Overall, this paper addresses two

  abstract: 'To the naked ear, the installation Being With The Waves appears silent,
    but a hidden composition of voices, instrumental tones, and maritime sounds is
    revealed through wearing modified headphones. The installation consists of an
    array of tweeters emitting a multi-channel ultrasonic composition that sounds
    physically in the space. Ultrasonic phenomena present at the listener’s ears are
    captured by microphones embedded on the outside of headphone earcups, shifted
    into audibility, and output to the headphones. The amplitude demodulation of ultrasonic
    material results in exaggerated Doppler effects and listeners hear the music bend
    and shift precisely with their movement. There are no movement sensors, mappings,
    or feedback loops, yet the installation is perceived as interactive due to the
    close entanglement of the listener with sound phenomena. The dynamic quality of
    interaction emerges solely through the listening faculties of the visitor, as
    an embodied sensory experience determined by their orientation to sounds, physical
    movement, and perceptual behaviour. This paper describes key influences on the
    installation, its ultrasonic technology, the design of modified headphones, and
    the compositional approach.'

  abstract: 'Musical grid interfaces are becoming an industry standard for interfaces
    that allow interaction with music software, electronics, or instruments. However,
    there are no clearly defined design standards or guidelines, resulting in grid
    interfaces being a multitude of interfaces with competing design approaches, making
    these already abstract UIs even more challenging. In this paper, we compare the
    co-existing design approaches of UIs for grid interfaces used by commercial and
    non-commercial developers and designers, and present the results of three experiments
    that tested the benefits of co-existing design approaches to mitigate some of
    the inherent design challenges.'

  abstract: 'Historically marginalised instruments witness and bear vital stories
    that can deeply affect identity and galvanise communities when revitalised. We
    present the protolangspil as a contemporary interpretation of the langspil, an
    Icelandic monochord-like folk instrument, and describe its agential and performative
    contributions to the first Icelandic NIME research lab. This paper describes how
    the proto-langspil has served as an instrument in establishing the research methodology
    of our new lab and concretised the research agenda via a series of encounters
    with music performers and composers, luthiers, anthropologists, musicologists,
    designers and philosophers. These encounters have informed and challenged our
    research practices, mapped our surroundings, and embedded us in the local social
    fabric. We share our proto-langspil for replication, and reflect on encounters
    as a methodology framing mechanism that eschews the more traditional empirical
    approaches in HCI. We conclude with a final provocation for NIME researchers to
    embrace AI research with an open mind.'

    experience of being a body, rather than simply a corporeal entity. Bodily knowledge,
    which evolves through bodily awareness, carries the lived body’s reflectivity.
    In this paper, such considerations are put in the context of previous work at
    NIME, specifically that revolving around with the vocal tract or the voice, due
    to its singular relation with embodiment. We understand that focusing on somaesthetics
    allows for novel ways of engaging with technology as well as highlighting biases
    that might go unnoticed otherwise. We present an inexpensive application of a
    respiration sensor that emerges from the aforementioned conceptualisations. Lastly,
    we reflect on how to better frame the role of bodily awareness in NIME.'

  abstract: 'The Kanchay_Yupana// is an open-source NIME for the generation of rhythms,
    inspired by the Andean yupana: a tangible board similar to an abacus of different
    sizes and materials with a system of carved geometric boxes into which seeds or
    pebbles were disposed to perform arithmetic calculations, used since pre-colonial
    times. As in the traditional artifact, the interaction of this new electronic
    yupana is based on the arrangement of seeds on a specially designed board with
    boxes, holes, and photoresistors. The shadow detected by the seeds’ positioning
    sends real-time motion data in MIDI messages to Pure Data in a drum machine patch.
    As a result, percussion samples of Andean instruments fill pulses in a four-quarter
    beat, generating patterns that can be transformed live into different rhythms.
    This interface complements the Electronic_Khipu_ (a previous NIME based on an
    Andean khipu) by producing the rhythmic component. This experience unites ancestral
    and contemporary technologies in experimental sound performance following the
    theoretical-practical research on the vindication of the memory in ancestral Andean
    technological interfaces made invisible by colonization, reusing them from a decolonial
    perspective in NIMEs.'

    their ability to anticipate and predict the other''s actions. We hypothesize that
    this intimacy between two people can be used as a basis for new controllers for
    musical expression. Looking at ways people communicate non-verbally, we are developing
    three new instruments based on different communication channels. The Tooka is
    a hollow tube with a pressure sensor and buttons for each player. Players place
    opposite ends in their mouths and modulate the pressure in the tube with their
    tongues and lungs, controlling sound. Coordinated button presses control the music
    as well. The Pushka, yet to be built, is a semirigid rod with strain gauges and
    position sensors to track the rod''s position. Each player holds opposite ends
    of the rod and manipulates it together. Bend, end point position, velocity and
    acceleration and torque are mapped to musical parameters. The Pullka, yet to be

  abstract: 'We have created a new electronic musical instrument, referred to as the
    Termenova (Russian for "daughter of Theremin") that combines a free-gesture capacitive
    sensing device with an optical sensing system that detects the reflection of a
    hand when it intersects a beam of an array of red lasers. The laser beams, which
    are made visible by a thin layer of theatrical mist, provide visual feedback and
    guidance to the performer to alleviate the difficulties of using a non-contact
    interface as well as adding an interesting component for the audience to observe.
    The system uses capacitive sensing to detect the proximity of the player''s hands;
    this distance is mapped to pitch, volume, or other continuous effect. The laser
    guide positions are calibrated before play with position controlled servo motors
    interfaced to a main controller board; the location of each beam corresponds to
    the position where the performer should move his or her hand to achieve a pre-specified
    pitch and/or effect. The optical system senses the distance of the player''s hands
    from the source of each laser beam, providing an additional dimension of musical
    control. '

  ID: Mandelis2002
  abstract: 'This paper describes the Genophone [2], a hyperinstrument developed for
    Sound-Performance-Design using the evolutionary paradigm of selective breeding
    as the driving process. Sound design, and control assignments (performance mappings),
    on most current systems rely heavily on an intimate knowledge of the Sound Synthesis
    Techniques (SSTs) employed by the sound generator (hardware or software based).
    This intimate knowledge can only be achieved by investing long periods of time
    playing around with sounds and experimenting with how parameters change the nature
    of the sounds produced. This experience is also needed when control mappings are
    defined for performance purposes, so external stimuli can effect changes in SST
    parameters. Often such experience can be gained after years of interaction with
    one particular SST. The system presented here attempts to aid the user in designing
    performance sounds and mappings without the necessity for deep knowledge of the
    SSTs involved. This is achieved by a selective breeding process on populations
    of individual sounds and their mapping. The initial populations are made up of
    individuals of existing hand-coded sounds and their mapping. Initial populations
    never have randomly derived individuals (this is not an issue as man''s best friend
    was also not selectively bred from protozoa). The user previews the population
    then expresses how much individuals are liked by their relative repositioning
    on the screen (fitness). Some individuals are selected as parents to create a
    new population of offspring, through variable mutation and genetic recombination.
    These operators use the fitness as a bias for their function, and they were also
    successfully used in MutaSynth [1]. The offspring are then evaluated (as their
    parents were) and selected for breeding. This cycle continues until satisfactory
    sounds and their mapping are reached. Individuals can also be saved to disk for
    future "strain" development. The aim of the system is to encourage the creation
    of novel performance mappings and sounds with emphasis on exploration, rather
    than designs that satisfy specific a priori criteria.'

  abstract: 'The Beatbugs are hand-held percussive instruments that allow the creation,
    manipulation, and sharing of rhythmic motifs through a simple interface. When
    multiple Beatbugs are connected in a network, players can form large-scale collaborative
    compositions by interdependently sharing and developing each other''s motifs.
    Each Beatbug player can enter a motif that is then sent through a stochastic computerized
    "Nerve Center" to other players in the network. Receiving players can decide whether
    to develop the motif further (by continuously manipulating pitch, timbre, and
    rhythmic elements using two bend sensor antennae) or to keep it in their personal
    instrument (by entering and sending their own new motifs to the group.) The tension
    between the system''s stochastic routing scheme and the players'' improvised real-time
    decisions leads to an interdependent, dynamic, and constantly evolving musical
    experience. A musical composition entitled "Nerve" was written for the system
    by author Gil Weinberg. It was premiered on February 2002 as part of Tod Machover''s
    Toy Symphony [1] in a concert with the Deutsches Symphonie Orchester Berlin, conducted

    A unit is constructed by simulating functional elements of conventional musical
    instruments, such as output timing of sound and pitch decision. Each unit has
    connectors for connecting other units to create various types of musical instruments.

  abstract: 'With the author’s own experiences in mind, this paper argues that, when
    used to amplify musical instruments or to play back other sonic material to an
    audience, loudspeakers and the technology that drives them, can be considered
    as a musical instrument. Particularly in situations with acoustic instruments
    this perspective can provide insight into the often cumbersome relation between
    the –technology orientated– sound engineer and the –music orientated– performer.
    Playing a musical instrument (whether acoustic, electric or electronic) involves
    navigating often complicated but very precise interfaces. The interface for sound
    amplification technology in a certain environment is not limited to the control
    surface of a mixing desk but includes the interaction with other stakeholder,
    i.e. the performers and the choice of loudspeakers and microphones and their positions.
    As such this interface can be as accurate and intimate but also as complicated
    as the interfaces of ''normal'' musical instruments. By zooming in on differences
    between acoustic and electronic sources a step is taken towards inclusion in this
    discussion of the perception of amplified music and the possible influence of
    that amplification on performance practise.'

  abstract: 'We present the Device Server, a framework and application driving interaction
    in the AlloSphere virtual reality environment. The motivation and development
    of the Device Server stems from the practical concerns of managing multi-user
    interactivity with a variety of physical devices for disparate performance and
    virtual reality environments housed in the same physical location. The interface
    of the Device Server allows users to see how devices are assigned to application
    functionalities, alter these assignments and save them into configuration files
    for later use. Configurations defining how applications use devices can be changed
    on the fly without recompiling or relaunching applications. Multiple applications
    can be connected to the Device Server concurrently. The Device Server provides
    several conveniences for performance environments. It can process control data
    efficiently using Just-In-Time compiled Lua expressions; in doing so it frees
    processing cycles on audio and video rendering computers. All control signals
    entering the Device Server can be recorded, saved, and played back allowing performances
    based on control data to be recreated in their entirety. The Device Server attempts
    to homogenize the appearance of different control signals to applications so that
    users can assign any interface element they choose to application functionalities
    and easily experiment with different control configurations.'

  abstract: 'Writing text messages (e.g. email, SMS, instant messaging) is a popular
    form of synchronous and asynchronous communication. However, when it comes to
    notifying users about new messages, current audio-based approaches, such as notification
    tones, are very limited in conveying information. In this paper we show how entire
    text messages can be encoded into a meaningful and euphonic melody in such a way
    that users can guess a message’s intention without actually seeing the content.
    First, as a proof of concept, we report on the findings of an initial on-line
    survey among 37 musicians and 32 non-musicians evaluating the feasibility and
    validity of our approach. We show that our representation is understandable and
    that there are no significant differences between musicians and non-musicians.
    Second, we evaluated the approach in a real world scenario based on a Skype plug-in.
    In a field study with 14 participants we showed that sonified text messages strongly
    impact on the users’ message checking behavior by significantly reducing the time
    between receiving and reading an incoming message.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce a wireless musical interface driven by grasping
    forces and human motion. The sounds generated by the traditional digital musical
    instruments are dependent on the physical shape of the musical instruments. The
    freedom of the musical performance is restricted by its structure. Therefore,
    the sounds cannot be generated with the body expression like the dance. We developed
    a ball-shaped interface, TwinkleBall, to achieve the free-style performance. A
    photo sensor is embedded in the translucent rubber ball to detect the grasping
    force of the performer. The grasping force is translated into the luminance intensity
    for processing. Moreover, an accelerometer is also embedded in the interface for
    motion sensing. By using these sensors, a performer can control the note and volume
    by varying grasping force and motion respectively. The features of the proposed
    interface are ball-shaped, wireless, and handheld size. As a result, the proposed
    interface is able to generate the sound from the body expression such as dance. '

    A set of experiments were carried out to verify the mechanical design improvements
    and the dynamic response of the air pressure. As a result, the range of sound
    pressure has been increased and the proposed control system improved the dynamic
    response of the air pressure control. '

  abstract: 'The evolution of networked audio technologies has created unprecedented
    opportunities for musicians to improvise with instrumentalists from a diverse

    shaped by new methodologies that respond to this potential. While networked technologies
    eliminate distance in physical space, for the remote improviser, this creates

    step in understanding the conditions arising from collaboration in networked audio
    platforms, this paper will examine selected case studies of improvisation in a

  abstract: 'Glitch DeLighter is a HyperInstrument conceived for Glitch music, based
    on the idea of using fire expressiveness to digitally distort sound, pushing the
    body and primitive ritualism into a computer mediated sound performance. Glitch
    DeLighter uses ordinary lighters as physical controllers that can be played by
    creating a flame and moving it in the air. Droned sounds are played by sustaining
    the flame and beats by generating sparks and fast flames. The pitch of every sound
    can be changed moving the flame vertically in the air. This is achieved by using
    a custom computer vision system as an interface which maps the real-time the data
    extracted from the flame and transmits those parameters to the sound generator.
    As a result, the flame visual dynamics are deeply connected to the aural perception
    of the sound - ‘the sound seems to be burning’. This process establishes a metaphor
    dramaturgically engaging for an audience. This paper contextualizes the glitch
    music aesthetics, prior research, the design and development of the instrument

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a method for studying relationships between
    features of sound and features of movement. The method has been tested by carrying
    out an experiment with people moving an object in space along with short sounds.
    3D position data of the object was recorded and several features were calculated
    from each of the recordings. These features were provided as input to a classifier
    which was able to classify the recorded actions satisfactorily, particularly when
    taking into account that the only link between the actions performed by the different
    subjects was the sound they heard while making the action.'

  abstract: '''''VirtualPhilharmony'''' (V.P.) is a conducting interface that enables
    users to perform expressive music with conducting action. Several previously developed
    conducting interfaces do not satisfy users who have conducting experience because
    the feedback from the conducting action does not always correspond with a natural
    performance. The tempo scheduler, which is the main engine of a conducting system,
    must be improved. V.P. solves this problem by introducing heuristics of conducting
    an orchestra in detecting beats, applying rules regarding the tempo expression
    in a bar, etc. We confirmed with users that the system realized a high "following"
    performance and had musical persuasiveness. '

  abstract: Awareness of playing movements can help a piano student to improve technique.
    We are developing a piano pedagogy application that uses sensor data of hand and
    arm movement and generates feedback to increase movement awareness. This paper
    reports on a method for analysis of piano playing movements. The method allows
    to judge whether an active movement in a joint has occurred during a given time
    interval. This time interval may include one or more touches. The problem is complicated
    by the fact that the mechanical interaction between the arm and piano action generates
    additional movements that are not under direct control of the player. The analysis
    method is able to ignore these movements and can therefore be used to provide
    useful feedback.

    DJs a new interface for mixing musicon the Nokia N900 phones. Mmmmm presents a
    novel way for DJ to become more interactive with their audience andvise versa.
    The software developed for the N900 mobilephone utilizes the phones built-in accelerometer
    sensor andBluetooth audio streaming capabilities to mix and apply effects to music
    using hand gestures and have the mixed audiostream to Bluetooth speakers, which
    allows the DJ to moveabout the environment and get familiarized with their audience,
    turning the experience of DJing into an interactiveand audience engaging process.
    Mmmmm is designed so that the DJ can utilize handgestures and haptic feedback
    to help them perform the various tasks involved in DJing (mixing, applying effects,
    andetc). This allows the DJ to focus on the crowd, thus providing the DJ a better
    intuition of what kind of music ormusical mixing style the audience is more likely
    to enjoyand engage with. Additionally, Mmmmm has an Ambient Tempo Detection mode
    in which the phones camera is utilized to detect the amount of movement in the
    environment and suggest to the DJ the tempo of music that should be played. This
    mode utilizes frame differencing and pixelchange overtime to get a sense of how
    fast the environmentis changing, loosely correlating to how fast the audience
    isdancing or the lights are flashing in the scene. By determining the ambient
    tempo of the environment the DJ canget a better sense for the type of music that
    would fit bestfor their venue.Mmmmm helps novice DJs achieve a better music repertoire
    by allowing them to interact with their audience andreceive direct feedback on
    their performance. The DJ canchoose to utilize these modes of interaction and
    performance or utilize traditional DJ controls using MmmmmsN900 touch screen based

  abstract: "In this paper, the authors describe how they use an electric bass as\
    \ a subtle, expressive and intuitive interface to browse the rich sample bank\
    \ available to most laptop owners. This is achieved by audio mosaicing of the\
    \ live bass performance audio, through corpus-based concatenative synthesis (CBCS)\
    \ techniques, allowing a mapping of the multi-dimensional expressivity of the\
    \ performance onto foreign audio material, thus recycling the virtuosity acquired\
    \ on the electric instrument with a trivial learning curve. This design hypothesis\
    \ is contextualised and assessed within the Sandbox#n series of bass+laptop meta-instruments,\
    \ and the authors describe technical means of the implementation through the use\
    \ of the open-source CataRT CBCS system adapted for live mosaicing. They also\

  abstract: 'The American experimental tradition in music emphasizes a process-oriented
    – rather than goal-oriented – composition style. According to this tradition,
    the composition process is considered an experiment beginning with a problem resolved
    by the composer. The noted experimental composer John Cage believed that the artist’s
    role in composition should be one of coexistence, as opposed to the traditional
    view of directly controlling the process. Consequently, Cage devel- oped methods
    of composing that upheld this philosophy by utilizing musical charts and the I
    Ching, also known as the Chinese Book of Changes. This project investigates these
    methods and models them via an interactive computer system to explore the use

  abstract: 'This paper investigates whether a dynamic vibrotactile feedback improves
    the playability of a gesture controlled virtual instrument. The instrument described
    in this study is based on a virtual control surface that player strikes with a
    hand held sensor-actuator device. We designed two tactile cues to augment the
    stroke across the control surface: a static and dynamic cue. The static cue was
    a simple burst of vibration triggered when crossing the control surface. The dynamic
    cue was continuous vibration increasing in amplitude when approaching the surface.
    We arranged an experiment to study the influence of the tactile cues in performance.
    In a tempo follow task, the dynamic cue yielded significantly the best temporal
    and periodic accuracy and control of movement velocity and amplitude. The static
    cue did not significantly improve the rhythmic accuracy but assisted the control
    of movement velocity compared to the condition without tactile feedback at all.
    The findings of the study indicate that careful design of dynamic vibrotactile
    feedback can improve the controllability of gesture based virtual instrument. '

    controllers whilst in addition giving tactile feedback to the user. Cymatic virtual
    instruments are set up via a graphical user interface in a manner that is highly

    with their physical shape and structure in terms of the physical properties of
    basic objects such as strings, membranes and solids which can be interconnected
    to form complex structures. The virtual instrument can be excited at any point
    mass by the following: bowing, plucking, striking, sine/square/sawtooth/random
    waveform, or an external sound source. Virtual microphones can be placed at any

    played as a musical instrument by a separate interface. The system uses a three
    layer feedforward backpropagation neural network which is trained by a discrete
    set of input-output examples. After training, the network extends the training
    set, which functions as the specification by example of the controller, to a continuous
    mapping allowing the real-time morphing of synthetic sound models.  We have implemented
    a prototype application using a controller which collects data from a hand-drawn

    whose frequencies, dampings, and gains are the parameters we control. We train
    the system by providing pictorial representations of physical objects such as
    a bell or a lamp, and associate high quality modal models obtained from measurements
    on real objects with these inputs. After training, the user can draw pictures

  abstract: 'In this paper, we discuss a design principle for the musical instruments
    that are useful for both novices and professional musicians and that facilitate
    musically rich expression. We believe that the versatility of conventional musical
    instruments causes difficulty in performance. By dynamically specializing a musical
    instrument for performing a specific (genre of) piece, the musical instrument
    could become more useful for performing the piece and facilitates expressive performance.
    Based on this idea, we developed two new types of musical instruments, i.e., a
    "given-melody-based musical instrument" and a "harmonic-function-based musical
    instrument". From the experimental results using two prototypes, we demonstrate
    the efficiency of the design principle.'

  abstract: 'The Overtone Fiddle is a new violin-family instrument that incorporates
    electronic sensors, integrated DSP, and physical actuation of the acoustic body.
    An embedded tactile sound transducer creates extra vibrations in the body of the
    Overtone Fiddle, allowing performer control and sensation via both traditional
    violin techniques, as well as extended playing techniques that incorporate shared
    man/machine control of the resulting sound. A magnetic pickup system is mounted
    to the end of the fiddle''s fingerboard in order to detect the signals from the
    vibrating strings, deliberately not capturing vibrations from the full body of
    the instrument. This focused sensing approach allows less restrained use of DSP-generated
    feedback signals, as there is very little direct leakage from the actuator embedded
    in the body of the instrument back to the pickup. '

  abstract: 'During the past decade, multi-touch surfaces have emerged as valuable
    tools for collaboration, display, interaction, and musical expression. Unfortunately,
    they tend to be costly and often suffer from two drawbacks for music performance:(1)
    relatively high latency owing to their sensing mechanism, and (2) lack of haptic
    feedback. We analyze the latency present in several current multi-touch platforms,
    and we describe a new custom system that reduces latency to an average of 30 ms
    while providing programmable haptic feed-back to the user. The paper concludes

  abstract: 'This paper describes the motivation and construction of Gamelan Elektrika,
    a new electronic gamelan modeled after a Balinese Gong Kebyar. The first of its
    kind, Elektrika consists of seven instruments acting as MIDI controllers accompanied
    by traditional percussion and played by 11 or more performers following Balinese
    performance practice. Three main percussive instrument designs were executed using
    a combination of force sensitive resistors, piezos, and capacitive sensing. While
    the instrument interfaces are designedto play interchangeably with the original,
    the sound andt ravel possiblilities they enable are tremendous. MIDI enables a
    massive new sound palette with new scales beyond the quirky traditional tuning
    and non-traditional sounds. It also allows simplified transcription for an aurally
    taught tradition. Significantly, it reduces the transportation challenges of a
    previously large and heavy ensemble, creating opportunities for wider audiences
    to experience Gong Kebyar''s enchanting sound. True to the spirit of oneness in
    Balinese music, as one of the first large all-MIDI ensembles, ElekTrika challenges
    performers to trust silent instruments and develop an understanding of highly
    intricate and interlocking music not through the sound of the individual, but
    through the sound of the whole.'

  abstract: 'Popular music (characterized by improvised instrumental parts, beat and
    measure-level organization, and steady tempo) poses challenges for human-computer
    music performance (HCMP). Pieces of music are typically rearrangeable on-the-fly
    and involve a high degree of variation from ensemble to ensemble, and even between
    rehearsal and performance. Computer systems aiming to participate in such ensembles
    must therefore cope with a dynamic high-level structure in addition to the more
    traditional problems of beat-tracking, score-following, and machine improvisation.
    There are many approaches to integrating the components required to implement
    dynamic human-computer music performance systems. This paper presents a reference
    architecture designed to allow the typical sub-components (e.g. beat-tracking,
    tempo prediction, improvisation) to be integrated in a consistent way, allowing
    them to be combined and/or compared systematically. In addition, the paper presents
    a dynamic score representation particularly suited to the demands of popular music
    performance by computer. '

    \ the controller and sound generator. The issue is oftenexacerbated by an audience's\

    \ there is a conflict underlyingmany novel musical instruments in that they are\

  abstract: 'The use of Interactive Evolutionary Computation (IEC) is suitable to
    the development of art-creation aid system for beginners. This is because of important
    features of IEC, like the ability of optimizing with ambiguous evaluation measures,
    and not requiring special knowledge about art-creation. With the popularity of
    Consumer Generated Media, many beginners in term of art-creation are interested
    in creating their own original art works. Thus developing of useful IEC system
    for musical creation is an urgent task. However, user-assist functions for IEC
    proposed in pastworks decrease the possibility of getting good unexpected results,
    which is an important feature of art-creation with IEC. In this paper, The author
    proposes a new IEC evaluation process named "Shopping Basket" procedure IEC. In
    the procedure, an user-assist function called Similarity-Based Reasoning allows
    for natural evaluation by the user. The function reduces user''s burden without
    reducing the possibility of unexpected results. The author performs an experiment
    where subjects use the new interface to validate it. As a result of the experiment,
    the author concludes that the new interface is better to motivate users to compose

  abstract: 'We introduce a novel algorithm for automatically generating rhythms in
    real time in a certain meter. The generated rhythms are "generic" in the sense
    that they are characteristic of each time signature without belonging to a specific
    musical style. The algorithm is based on a stochastic model in which various aspects
    and qualities of the generated rhythm can be controlled intuitively and in real
    time. Such qualities are the density of the generated events per bar, the amount
    of variation in generation, the amount of syncopation, the metrical strength,
    and of course the meter itself. The kin.rhythmicator software application was
    developed to implement this algorithm. During a performance with the kin.rhythmicator
    the user can control all aspects of the performance through descriptive and intuitive
    graphic controls. '

  abstract: 'Audio mixing is the adjustment of relative volumes, panning and other
    parameters corresponding to different soundsources, in order to create a technically
    and aesthetically adequate sound sum. To do this, audio engineers employ "panpots"
    and faders, the standard controls in audio mixers. The design of such devices
    has remained practically unchanged for decades since their introduction. At the
    time,no usability studies seem to have been conducted on suchdevices, so one could
    question if they are really optimizedfor the task they are meant for.This paper
    proposes a new set of controls that might beused to simplify and/or improve the
    performance of audiomixing tasks, taking into account the spatial characteristicsof

  abstract: 'We developed a kinetic particles synthesizer for mobile devices having
    a multi-touch screen such as a tablet PC and a smart phone. This synthesizer generates
    music based on the kinetics of particles under a two-dimensional physics engine.
    The particles move in the screen to synthesize sounds according to their own physical
    properties, which are shape, size, mass, linear and angular velocity, friction,
    restitution, etc. If a particle collides with others, a percussive sound is generated.
    A player can play music by the simple operation of touching or dragging on the
    screen of the device. Using a three-axis acceleration sensor, a player can perform
    music by shuffling or tilting the device. Each particle sounds just a simple tone.
    However, a large amount of various particles play attractive music by aggregating
    their sounds. This concept has been inspired by natural sounds made from an assembly
    of simple components, for example, rustling leaves or falling rain. For a novice
    who has no experience of playing a musical instrument, it is easy to learn how
    to play instantly and enjoy performing music with intuitive operation. Our system
    is used for musical instruments for interactive music entertainment. '

    In analogy with the perception of thesounds'' causality, we propose to distinguish
    gestures that "mimic" a sound''s cause and gestures that "trace" a sound''smorphology
    following temporal sound characteristics. Results from the interviews show that,
    first, our causal soundsdatabase lead to consistent descriptions of the action

  abstract: 'The use of physiological signals in Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
    is becoming popular and widespread, mostly due to sensors miniaturization and
    advances in real-time processing. However, most of the studies that use physiology
    based interaction focus on single-user paradigms, and its usage in collaborative
    scenarios is still in its beginning. In this paper we explore how interactive
    sonification of brain and heart signals, and its representation through physical
    objects (physiopucks) in a tabletop interface may enhance motivational and controlling
    aspects of music collaboration. A multimodal system is presented, based on an
    electrophysiology sensor system and the Reactable, a musical tabletop interface.
    Performance and motivation variables were assessed in an experiment involving
    a test "Physio" group(N=22) and a control "Placebo" group (N=10). Pairs of participants
    used two methods for sound creation: implicit interaction through physiological
    signals, and explicit interaction by means of gestural manipulation. The results
    showed that pairs in the Physio Group declared less difficulty, higher confidence
    and more symmetric control than the Placebo Group, where no real-time sonification
    was provided as subjects were using pre-recorded physiological signal being unaware
    of it. These results support the feasibility of introducing physiology-based interaction
    in multimodal interfaces for collaborative music generation.'

  abstract: 'Computer music systems that coordinate or interact with human musicians
    exist in many forms. Often, coordination is at the level of gestures and phrases
    without synchronization at the beat level (or perhaps the notion of "beat" does
    not even exist). In music with beats, fine-grain synchronization can be achieved
    by having humans adapt to the computer (e.g. following a click track), or by computer
    accompaniment in which the computer follows a predetermined score. We consider
    an alternative scenario in which improvisation prevents traditional score following,
    but where synchronization is achieved at the level of beats, measures, and cues.
    To explore this new type of human-computer interaction, we have created new software

  abstract: 'A novel method of digital scratching is presented as an alternative to
    currently available digital hardware interfaces and time-coded vinyl (TCV). Similar
    to TCV, the proposed method leverages existing analog turntables as a physical
    interface to manipulate the playback of digital audio. To doso, however, an accelerometer/gyroscope–equipped
    smartphone is firmly attached to a modified record, placed on a turntable, and
    used to sense a performers movement, resulting in a wireless sensing-based scratching
    method. The accelerometer and gyroscope data is wirelessly transmitted to a computer
    to manipulate the digital audio playback in real-time. The method provides the
    benefit of digital audio and storage, requires minimal additional hardware, accommodates
    familiar proprioceptive feedback, and allows a single interface to control both
    digital and analog audio. In addition, the proposed method provides numerous additional
    benefits including real-time graphical display,multi-touch interaction, and untethered
    performance (e.g“air-scratching”). Such a method turns a vinyl record into an
    interactive surface and enhances traditional scratching performance by affording
    new and creative musical interactions. Informal testing show this approach to
    be viable,responsive, and robust.'

    fluency in improvisation, a music game has been designed and evaluated through
    video analysis: A qualitative view of mutual action describes the social context
    of music improvisation: how two people with speech, laughter, gestures, postures
    and pauses negotiate individual and joint action. The objective behind the design
    of the game application was to support players in some aspects of their mutual
    play. Results show that even though players activated additional sound feedback
    as a result of their mutual play, players also engaged in forms of mutual play
    that the game engine did not account for. These ways of mutual play are descibed
    further along with some suggestions for how to direct future designs of collaborative

  abstract: 'The Bass Sleeve uses an Arduino board with a combination of buttons,
    switches, flex sensors, force sensing resistors, and an accelerometer to map the
    ancillary movements of a performer to sampling, real-time audio and video processing
    including pitch shifting, delay, low pass filtering, and onscreen video movement.
    The device was created to augment the existing functions of the electric bass
    and explore the use of ancillary gestures to control the laptop in a live performance.
    In this research it was found that incorporating ancillary gestures into a live
    performance could be useful when controlling the parameters of audio processing,
    sound synthesis and video manipulation. These ancillary motions can be a practical
    solution to gestural multitasking allowing independent control of computer music
    parameters while performing with the electric bass. The process of performing
    with the Bass Sleeve resulted in a greater amount of laptop control, an increase
    in the amount of expressiveness using the electric bass in combination with the
    laptop, and an improvement in the interactivity on both the electric bass and
    laptop during a live performance. The design uses various gesture-to-sound mapping
    strategies to accomplish a compositional task during an electro acoustic multimedia

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe an implementation of a real-time sound synthesizer
    using Finite Difference-based simulation of a two-dimensional membrane. Finite
    Difference (FD) methods can be the basis for physics-based music instrument models
    that generate realistic audio output. However, such methods are compute-intensive;
    large simulations cannot run in real time on current CPUs. Many current systems
    now include powerful Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), which are a good fit for
    FD methods. We demonstrate that it is possible to use this method to create a
    usable real-time audio synthesizer. '

  abstract: 'Interacting with musical avatars have been increasingly popular over
    the years, with the introduction of games likeGuitar Hero and Rock Band. These
    games provide MIDIequipped controllers that look like their real-world counterparts
    (e.g. MIDI guitar, MIDI drumkit) that the users playto control their designated
    avatar in the game. The performance of the user is measured against a score that
    needs tobe followed. However, the avatar does not move in responseto how the user
    plays, it follows some predefined movementpattern. If the user plays badly, the
    game ends with theavatar ending the performance (i.e. throwing the guitar onthe
    floor). The gaming experience would increase if theavatar would move in accordance
    with user input. This paper presents an architecture that couples musical input
    withbody movement. Using imitation learning, a simulated human robot learns to
    play the drums like human drummersdo, both visually and auditory. Learning data
    is recordedusing MIDI and motion tracking. The system uses an artificial intelligence
    approach to implement imitation learning,employing artificial neural networks.'

  abstract: 'The goal of our research is to find ways of supporting and encouraging
    musical behavior by non-musicians in shared public performance environments. Previous
    studies indicated simultaneous music listening and performance is difficult for
    non-musicians, and that visual support for the task might be helpful. This paper
    presents results from a preliminary user study conducted to evaluate the effect
    of visual feedback on a musical tracking task. Participants generated a musical
    signal by manipulating a hand-held device with two dimensions of control over
    two parameters, pitch and density of note events, and were given the task of following
    a target pattern as closely as possible. The target pattern was a machine-generated
    musical signal comprising of variation over the same two parameters. Visual feedback
    provided participants with information about the control parameters of the musical
    signal generated by the machine. We measured the task performance under different
    visual feedback strategies. Results show that single parameter visualizations
    tend to improve the tracking performance with respect to the visualized parameter,
    but not the non-visualized parameter. Visualizing two independent parameters simultaneously
    decreases performance in both dimensions. '

  abstract: 'This paper proposes a new research direction for the large family of
    instrumental musical interfaces where sound is generated using digital granular
    synthesis, and where interaction and control involve the (fine) operation of stiff,
    flat contact surfaces. First, within a historical context, a general absence of,
    and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically instantiated by the grain-generating
    process itself is identified. Second, to fill this gap, a concrete general approach
    is proposed based on the careful construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force
    pulses, in a one-to-one relationship with sonic grains.An informal pilot psychophysics
    experiment initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the
    two main cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral.
    Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably
    multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process. Moreover,
    it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real time) in the
    same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a trivial property,
    and provides an important and positive fundament for further developing this type
    of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting prospect of making arbitrary
    sonic grains actual physical manipulanda. '

    \ uploads his consciousness into anelaborate computer system to preserve his essence\
    \ and agencyafter his corporeal death. Consequently, for much of theopera, the\
    \ stage and the environment itself come alive asthe main character. This creative\
    \ need brings with it a hostof technical challenges and opportunities. In order\
    \ to satisfythe needs of this storyline, Machover's Opera of the Futuregroup at\
    \ the MIT Media Lab has developed a suite of newperformance technologies, including\
    \ robot characters, interactive performance capture systems, mapping systems for,\n\
    ,\nauthoring interactive multimedia performances, new musical instruments, unique\
    \ spatialized sound controls, anda unified control system for all these technological\
    \ components. While developed for a particular theatrical production, many of\
    \ the concepts and design procedures remain relevant to broader contexts including\
    \ performance,robotics, and interaction design."

  abstract: 'In this paper we introduce a multimodal platform for Hybrid Reality live
    performances: by means of non-invasiveVirtual Reality technology, we developed
    a system to presentartists and interactive virtual objects in audio/visual choreographies
    on the same real stage. These choreographiescould include spectators too, providing
    them with the possibility to directly modify the scene and its audio/visual features.
    We also introduce the first interactive performancestaged with this technology,
    in which an electronic musician played live five tracks manipulating the 3D projectedvisuals.
    As questionnaires have been distributed after theshow, in the last part of this
    work we discuss the analysisof collected data, underlining positive and negative
    aspectsof the proposed experience.This paper belongs together with a performance
    proposalcalled Dissonance, in which two performers exploit the platform to create

  abstract: 'We conducted three studies with contemporary music composers at IRCAM.
    We found that even highly computer-literate composers use an iterative process
    that begins with expressing musical ideas on paper, followed by active parallel
    exploration on paper and in software, prior to final execution of their ideas
    as an original score. We conducted a participatory design study that focused on
    the creative exploration phase, to design tools that help composers better integrate
    their paper-based and electronic activities. We then developed InkSplorer as a
    technology probe that connects users'' hand-written gestures on paper to Max/MSP
    and OpenMusic. Composers appropriated InkSplorer according to their preferred
    composition styles, emphasizing its ability to help them quickly explore musical
    ideas on paper as they interact with the computer. We conclude with recommendations
    for designing interactive paper tools that support the creative process, letting
    users explore musical ideas both on paper and electronically. '

  abstract: 'The DJ culture uses a gesture lexicon strongly rooted in thetraditional

    this lexicon is adaptedto the features they provide. In particular, multitouch
    technologies can offer a new syntax while still supporting the oldlexicon, which
    is desired by DJs.We present a classification of DJ tools, from an interaction
    point of view, that divides the previous work into Traditional, Virtual and Hybrid
    setups. Moreover, we presenta multitouch tabletop application, developed with
    a groupof DJ consultants to ensure an adequate implementation ofthe traditional
    gesture lexicon.To conclude, we conduct an expert evaluation, with tenDJ users
    in which we compare the three DJ setups with ourprototype. The study revealed
    that our proposal suits expectations of Club/Radio-DJs, but fails against the
    mentalmodel of Scratch-DJs, due to the lack of haptic feedback torepresent the
    record''s physical rotation. Furthermore, testsshow that our multitouch DJ setup,

  abstract: 'In the past decade we have seen a growing presence of tabletop systems
    applied to music, lately with even some products becoming commercially available
    and being used byprofessional musicians in concerts. The development of thistype
    of applications requires several demanding technicalexpertises such as input processing,
    graphical design, realtime sound generation or interaction design, and because
    ofthis complexity they are usually developed by a multidisciplinary group.In this
    paper we present the Musical Tabletop CodingFramework (MTCF) a framework for designing
    and codingmusical tabletop applications by using the graphical programming language
    for digital sound processing Pure Data(Pd). With this framework we try to simplify
    the creationprocess of such type of interfaces, by removing the need ofany programming
    skills other than those of Pd.'

  abstract: 'The use of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) in the experimental
    arts is not a novel concept. Since 1965, EEG has been used in a large number of,
    sometimes highly sophisticated, systems for musical and artistic expression. However,
    since the advent of the synthesizer, most such systems have utilized digital and/or
    synthesized media in sonifying the EEG signals. There have been relatively few
    attempts to create interfaces for musical expression that allow one to mechanically
    manipulate acoustic instruments by modulating one''s mental state. Secondly, few
    such systems afford a distributed performance medium, with data transfer and audience
    participation occurring over the Internet. The use of acoustic instruments and
    Internet-enabled communication expands the realm of possibilities for musical
    expression in Brain-Computer Music Interfaces (BCMI), while also introducing additional
    challenges. In this paper we report and examine a first demonstration (Music for
    Online Performer) of a novel system for Internet-enabled manipulation of robotic
    acoustic instruments, with feedback, using a non-invasive EEG-based BCI and low-cost,
    commercially available robotics hardware. '

  abstract: 'We developed very small and light sensors, each equippedwith 3-axes accelerometers,
    magnetometers and gyroscopes.Those MARG (Magnetic, Angular Rate, and Gravity)
    sensors allow for a drift-free attitude computation which in turnleads to the
    possibility of recovering the skeleton of bodyparts that are of interest for the
    performance, improvingthe results of gesture recognition and allowing to get relative
    position between the extremities of the limbs and thetorso of the performer. This
    opens new possibilities in termsof mapping. We kept our previous approach developed
    atARTeM [2]: wireless from the body to the host computer,but wired through a 4-wire
    digital bus on the body. Byrelieving the need for a transmitter on each sensing
    node,we could built very light and flat sensor nodes that can bemade invisible
    under the clothes. Smaller sensors, coupledwith flexible wires on the body, give
    more freedom of movement to dancers despite the need for cables on the body.And
    as the weight of each sensor node, box included, isonly 5 grams (Figure 1), they
    can also be put on the upper and lower arm and hand of a violin or viola player,
    toretrieve the skeleton from the torso to the hand, withoutadding any weight that
    would disturb the performer. Weused those sensors in several performances with
    a dancingviola player and in one where she was simultaneously controlling gas
    flames interactively. We are currently applyingthem to other types of musical

  abstract: 'As a response to a number of notable contemporary aesthetic tendencies,
    this paper introduces the notion of an infra-instrument as a kind of ‘new interface
    for musical expression’ worthy of study and systematic design. In contrast to
    hyper-, meta- and virtual instruments, we propose infra-instruments as devices
    of restricted interactive potential, with little sensor enhancement, which engender
    simple musics with scarce opportunity for conventional virtuosity. After presenting
    numerous examples from our work, we argue that it is precisely such interactionally
    and sonically challenged designs that leave requisite space for computer-generated

  abstract: 'The iltur system features a novel method of interaction between expert
    and novice musicians through a set of musical controllers called Beatbugs. Beatbug
    players can record live musical input from MIDI and acoustic instruments and respond
    by transforming the recorded material in real-time, creating motif-and-variation
    call-and-response routines on the fly. A central computer system analyzes MIDI
    and audio played by expert players and allows novice Beatbug players to personalize
    the analyzed material using a variety of transformation algorithms. This paper
    presents the motivation for developing the iltur system, followed by a brief survey
    of pervious and related work that guided the definition of the project’s goals.
    We then present the hardware and software approaches that were taken to address
    these goals, as well as a couple of compositions that were written for the system.

  abstract: 'This paper will investigate a variety of alternate controllers that are
    making an impact in interactive entertainment, particularly in the video game
    industry. Since the late 1990''s, the surging popularity of rhythmic and musical
    performance games in Japanese arcades has led to the development of new interfaces
    and alternate controllers for the consumer market worldwide. Rhythm action games
    such as Dance Dance Revolution, Taiko No Tatsujin (Taiko: Drum Master), and Donkey
    Konga are stimulating collaborative gameplay and exposing consumers to custom
    controllers designed specifically for musical and physical interaction. We are
    witnessing the emergence and acceptance of these breakthrough controllers and
    models for gameplay as an international cultural phenomenon penetrating the video
    game and toy markets in record numbers. Therefore, it is worth considering the
    potential benefits to developers of musical interfaces, electronic devices and

    the performer with proprioceptive feedback. Also, due to the mass of the wheel

  abstract: 'Artists have long sought after alternative controllers, sensors, and
    other means for controlling computer-based musical performance in real-time. Traditional
    techniques for transmitting the data generated by such devices typically employ
    the use of MIDI as the transport protocol. Recently, several devices have been
    developed using alternatives to MIDI, including Ethernet-based and USB-based sensor
    interfaces. We have designed and produced a system that uses S/PDIF as the transport
    mechanism for a sensor interface. This provides robust performance, together with
    extremely low latency and high resolution. In our system, data from all sensors
    is multiplexed onto the digital audio line and demultiplexed in software on the
    computer using standard techniques. We have written demultiplexer objects and
    plugins for Max/MSP and Jade, as well as a MIDI Conversion program for interapplicaton
    uses, while others are in the works for PD, SuperCollider, and AudioUnits.'

  abstract: 'When learning a classical instrument, people often either take lessons
    in which an existing body of “technique” is de- livered, evolved over generations
    of performers, or in some cases people will “teach themselves” by watching people
    play and listening to existing recordings. What does one do with a complex new
    digital instrument? In this paper I address this question drawing on my expe-
    rience in learning several very different types of sophisticated instruments:
    the Glove Talk II real-time gesture-to-speech interface, the Digital Marionette
    controller for virtual 3D puppets, and pianos and keyboards. As the primary user
    of the first two systems, I have spent hundreds of hours with Digital Marionette
    and Glove-Talk II, and thousands of hours with pianos and keyboards (I continue
    to work as a professional musician). I will identify some of the under- lying
    principles and approaches that I have observed during my learning and playing
    experience common to these instru- ments. While typical accounts of users learning
    new inter- faces generally focus on reporting beginner’s experiences, for various
    practical reasons, this is fundamentally different by focusing on the expert’s

  abstract: 'The breath pressure signal applied to wind music instruments is generally
    considered to be a slowly varying function of time. In a context of music control,
    this assumptionimplies that a relatively low digital sample rate (100-200Hz) is
    sufficient to capture and/or reproduce this signal.We tested this assumption by
    evaluating the frequency content in breath pressure, particularly during the use
    of extended performance techniques such as growling, humming,and flutter tonguing.
    Our results indicate frequency contentin a breath pressure signal up to about
    10 kHz, with especially significant energy within the first 1000 Hz. We furtherinvestigated
    the frequency response of several commerciallyavailable pressure sensors to assess
    their responsiveness tohigher frequency breath signals. Though results were mixed,some
    devices were found capable of sensing frequencies upto at least 1.5 kHz. Finally,
    similar measurements were conducted with Yamaha WX11 and WX5 wind controllers
    andresults suggest that their breath pressure outputs are sampled at about 320
    Hz and 280 Hz, respectively.'

  abstract: 'Tangible Acoustic Interfaces (TAI) rely on various acousticsensing technologies,
    such as sound source location and acoustic imaging, to detect the position of
    contact of users interacting with the surface of solid materials. With their ability
    to transform almost any physical objects, flat or curved surfaces and walls into
    interactive interfaces, acoustic sensing technologies show a promising way to
    bring the sense of touch into the realm of computer interaction. Because music
    making has been closely related to this sense during centuries, an application
    of particular interest is the use of TAI''s for the design of new musical instruments

    and the metaphors for interaction. The integration of the three modalities offers
    completely innovative capacities for interaction. The objectives are scientific,

    and over a long duration in order to measure its solidity, its reliability and
    its interest for users. Thus, during the last three months of the project, a demonstrator

  abstract: 'The HandySinger system is a personified tool developed to naturally express
    a singing voice controlled by the gestures of a hand puppet. Assuming that a singing
    voice is a kind of musical expression, natural expressions of the singing voice
    are important for personification. We adopt a singing voice morphing algorithm
    that effectively smoothes out the strength of expressions delivered with a singing
    voice. The system’s hand puppet consists of a glove with seven bend sensors and
    two pressure sensors. It sensitively captures the user’s motion as a personified
    puppet’s gesture. To synthesize the different expressional strengths of a singing
    voice, the “normal” (without expression) voice of a particular singer is used
    as the base of morphing, and three different expressions, “dark,” “whisper” and
    “wet,” are used as the target. This configuration provides musically expressed
    controls that are intuitive to users. In the experiment, we evaluate whether 1)
    the morphing algorithm interpolates expressional strength in a perceptual sense,
    2) the handpuppet interface provides gesture data at sufficient resolution, and
    3) the gestural mapping of the current system works as planned.'

  abstract: 'Bangarama is a music controller using headbanging as the primary interaction
    metaphor. It consists of a head-mounted tilt sensor and aguitar-shaped controller
    that does not require complex finger positions. We discuss the specific challenges
    of designing and building this controller to create a simple, yet responsive and
    playable instrument, and show how ordinary materials such as plywood, tinfoil,
    and copper wire can be turned into a device that enables a fun, collaborative

  abstract: 'In recent years Computer Network-Music has increasingly captured the
    attention of the Computer Music Community. With the advent of Internet communication,
    geographical displacement amongst the participants of a computer mediated music
    performance achieved world wide extension. However, when established over long
    distance networks, this form of musical communication has a fundamental problem:
    network latency (or net-delay) is an impediment for real-time collaboration. From
    a recent study, carried out by the authors, a relation between network latency
    tolerance and Music Tempo was established. This result emerged from an experiment,
    in which simulated network latency conditions were applied to the performance
    of different musicians playing jazz standard tunes. The Public Sound Objects (PSOs)
    project is web-based shared musical space, which has been an experimental framework
    to implement and test different approaches for on-line music communication. This
    paper describe features implemented in the latest version of the PSOs system,
    including the notion of a network-music instrument incorporating latency as a
    software function, by dynamically adapting its tempo to the communication delay
    measured in real-time.'

  abstract: 'This paper reports our recent development on a reconfigurable user interface.
    We created a system that consists of a dial type controller ‘Spinner’, and the
    GUI (Graphical User Interface) objects for the Max/MSP environment[1]. One physical
    controller corresponds to one GUI controller on a PC’s display device, and a user
    can freely change the connection on the fly (i.e. associate the physical controller
    to another GUI controller). Since the user interface on the PC side is running
    on the Max/MSP environment that has high flexibility, a user can freely reconfigure
    the layout of GUI controllers. A single ‘Spinner’ control device consists of a
    rotary encoder with a push button to count rotations and a photo IC to detect
    specific patterns from the GUI objects to identify. Since ‘Spinner’ features a
    simple identification method, it is capable of being used with normal display
    devices like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) and so on.
    A user can access multiple ‘Spinner’ devices simultaneously. By using this system,
    a user can build a reconfigurable user interface.'

    1970s. Work has been done by many artists and technologists in the intervening
    years to attempt to control music systems with brainwaves and --- indeed --- many
    other biological signals. Despite the richness of EEG, fMRI and other data which
    can be read from the human brain, there has up to now been only limited success

  abstract: 'OROBORO is a novel collaborative controller which focuses on musical
    performance as social experience by exploring synchronized actions of two musicians
    operating a single instrument. Each performer uses two paddle mechanisms – one
    for hand orientation sensing and one for servo-motor actuated feedback. We introduce
    a haptic mirror in which the movement of one performer’s sensed hand is used to
    induce movement of the partner’s actuated hand and vice versa. We describe theoretical
    motivation, and hardware/software implementation.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes two new live performance scenarios for performing
    music using bluetooth-enabled mobile phones. Interaction between mobile phones
    via wireless link is a key feature of the performance interface for each scenario.
    Both scenarios are discussed in the context of two publicly performed works for
    an ensemble of players in which mobile phone handsets are used both as sound sources
    and as hand-held controllers. In both works mobile phones are mounted in a specially
    devised pouch attached to a cord and physically swung to produce audio chorusing.
    During performance some players swing phones while others operate phones as hand-held
    controllers. Wireless connectivity enables interaction between flying and hand-held
    phones. Each work features different bluetooth implementations. In one a dedicated
    mobile phone acts as a server that interconnects multiple clients, while in the
    other point to point communication takes place between clients on an ad hoc basis.
    The paper summarises bluetooth tools designed for live performance realisation
    and concludes with a comparative evaluation of both scenarios for future implementation
    of performance by large ensembles of nonexpert players performing microtonal music
    using ubiquitous technology. '

    These areoften required to handle sensors where the physical parametercannot easily

    beyond simple on/off.The gluion approaches these challenges thru its FPGA-baseddesign
    which allows for a large number of digital I/O modules.It also provides superior
    flexibility regarding theirconfiguration, resolution, and functionality. In addition,

    is an instrument which takes as a starting point a guitar but his role is to bring
    different and new musical possibilities while preserving the spirit and techniques
    of guitar. Therefore, it was conceived and carried out starting from the body
    of an electric guitar. The fingerboard of this guitar was equipped with two lines
    of sensors: linear position sensors, and tactile pressure sensors. These two lines
    of sensors are used as two virtual strings. Their two ends are the bridge and
    the nut of the guitar. The design of the instrument is made in a way that the
    position of a finger, on one of these virtual strings, corresponds to the note,
    which would have been played on a real and vibrating string. On the soundboard
    of the guitar, a controller, with 3 degrees of freedom, allows to drive other
    synthesis parameters. We then describe how this interface is integrated in a musical
    audio system and serves as a musical instrument. '

  abstract: 'A cost-effective method was developed for the estimation of the bow velocity
    in violin playing, using an accelerometer on the bow in combination with point
    tracking using a standard video camera. The video data are used to detect the
    moments of bow direction changes. This information is used for piece-wise integration
    of the accelerometer signal, resulting in a drift-free reconstructed velocity
    signal with a high temporal resolution. The method was evaluated using a 3D motion
    capturing system, providing a reliable reference of the actual bow velocity. The
    method showed good results when the accelerometer and video stream are synchronized.
    Additional latency and jitter of the camera stream can importantly decrease the
    performance of the method, depending on the bow stroke type. '

  abstract: 'Designing a conducting gesture analysis system for public spacesposes
    unique challenges. We present conga, a software framework that enables automatic
    recognition and interpretation ofconducting gestures. conga is able to recognize
    multiple types ofgestures with varying levels of difficulty for the user to perform,from
    a standard four-beat pattern, to simplified up-down conducting movements, to no
    pattern at all. conga provides an extendablelibrary of feature detectors linked
    together into a directed acyclicgraph; these graphs represent the various conducting
    patterns asgesture profiles. At run-time, conga searches for the best profileto
    match a user''s gestures in real-time, and uses a beat prediction algorithm to
    provide results at the sub-beat level, in additionto output values such as tempo,
    gesture size, and the gesture''sgeometric center. Unlike some previous approaches,
    conga doesnot need to be trained with sample data before use. Our preliminary
    user tests show that conga has a beat recognition rate ofover 90%. conga is deployed
    as the gesture recognition systemfor Maestro!, an interactive conducting exhibit

    from which it should be possible to visualize all the emotions and intents or
    more precisely "intent graphs". To perform this, the collected data defining low-level
    descriptors are aggregated and converted into high-level characterizations. Then,
    depending on the retrieved data and on their distributionon the axis, we partition
    the universes into classes. The last stepis the building of the fuzzy rules that
    are obtained from the classes and that permit to give conclusions to label the
    detected emotions.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes recent enhancements in an interactive system designed
    to improvise with saxophonist John Butcher [1]. In addition to musical parameters
    such as pitch and loudness, our system is able to analyze timbral characteristics
    of the saxophone tone in real-time, and use timbral information to guide the generation
    of response material. We capture each saxophone gesture on the fly, extract a
    set of gestural and timbral contours, and store them in a repository. Improvising
    agents can consult the repository when generating responses. The gestural or timbral
    progression of a saxophone phrase can be remapped or transformed; this enables
    a variety of response material that also references audible contours of the original
    saxophone gestures. A single simple framework is used to manage gestural and timbral
    information extracted from analysis, and for expressive control of virtual instruments
    in a free improvisation context. '

  abstract: 'The MATRIX (Multipurpose Array of Tactile Rods for Interactive eXpression)
    is a new musical interface for amateurs and professionals alike. It gives users
    a 3dimensional tangible interface to control music using their hands, and can
    be used in conjunction with a traditional musical instrument and a microphone,
    or as a stand-alone gestural input device. The surface of the MATRIX acts as areal-time
    interface that can manipulate the parameters of a synthesis engine or effect algorithm
    in response to a performer''s expressive gestures. One example is to have the
    rods of the MATRIX control the individual grains of a granular synthesizer, thereby
    "sonically sculpting" the microstructure of a sound. In this way, the MATRIX provides
    an intuitive method of manipulating sound with avery high level of real-time control.'

    replaceable interfaces, which enable participants to discover andselect their
    favorite playing styles of musical instruments during a musicalsession. In addition,
    it has a wireless communication function thatsynchronizes musical scale and BPM
    between multiple devices. To date, various kinds of ``inventive'''' electronic
    musical instruments havebeen created in the field of Computer Music field. The
    authors are interestedin formations of musical sessions, aiming for a balance
    between simpleinteraction and musical expression. This study focuses on the development
    ofperformance playing styles.Musicians occasionally change their playing styles
    (e.g., guitar pluckingstyle) during a musical session. Generally, it is difficult
    for nonmusicians toachieve this kind of smooth changing depends on levels of their
    skillacquisition. However, it is essentially important for enjoying musical sessionswhether
    people could acquire these skills. Here, the authors attempted to develop the
    device that supports nonmusicians toconquer this point using replaceable interfaces.
    The authors expected thatchanging interfaces would bring similar effect as changing
    playing style by theskillful player. This research aims to establish an environment
    in whichnonmusicians and musicians share their individual musical ideas easily.
    Here,the interaction design and configuration of the ``POWDER BOX'''' is presented.'

  abstract: 'We present an interactive content-based MIR environment specifically
    designedto aid in the exploration of databases of experimental electronic music,particularly
    in cases where little or no metadata exist. In recent years,several rare archives
    of early experimental electronic music have becomeavailable. The Daphne Oram Collection
    contains one such archive, consisting ofapproximately 120 hours of 1/4 inch tape
    recordings and representing a perioddating from circa 1957. This collection is
    recognized as an importantmusicological resource, representing aspects of the
    evolution of electronicmusic practices, including early tape editing methods,
    experimental synthesistechniques and composition. However, it is extremely challenging
    to derivemeaningful information from this dataset, primarily for three reasons.
    First,the dataset is very large. Second, there is limited metadata --- some titles,track
    lists, and occasional handwritten notes exist, but where this is true,the reliability
    of the annotations are unknown. Finally, and mostsignificantly, as this is a collection
    of early experimental electronic music,the sonic characteristics of the material
    are often not consistent withtraditional musical information. In other words,
    there is no score, no knowninstrumentation, and often no recognizable acoustic
    source. We present amethod for the construction of a frequency component dictionary
    derived fromthe collection via Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA),
    anddemonstrate how an interactive 3D visualization of the relationships betweenthe
    PLCA-derived dictionary and the archive is facilitating researcher''sunderstanding

    Indeed, the mapping between the DMI''s sensoryinputs and sonic outputs is classically
    treated as a black box. DMI designersand builders are forced to design and schedule
    the flow of data through thisblack box on their own. Improper design of the data

  abstract: 'Touch user interfaces such as touchpad or pen tablet are often used forcontinuous
    pitch control in synthesis devices. Usually, pitch is set at thecontact point
    on the interface, thus introducing possible pitch inaccuracies atthe note onset.
    This paper proposes a new algorithm, based on an adaptiveattraction mapping, for
    improving initial pitch accuracy with touch userinterfaces with continuous control.
    At each new contact on the interface, thealgorithm adjusts the mapping to produce
    the most likely targeted note of thescale in the vicinity of the contact point.
    Then, pitch remains continuouslyadjustable as long as the contact is maintained,
    allowing for vibrato,portamento and other subtle melodic control. The results
    of experimentscomparing the users'' pitch accuracy with and without the help of
    the algorithmshow that such a correction enables to play sharply in tune at the
    contact withthe interface, regardless the musical background of the player. Therefore,
    thedynamic mapping algorithm allows for a clean and accurate attack when playing

  abstract: 'So far, there are few studies of string instruments with bows because
    there aremany parameters to acquire skills and it is difficult to measure theseparameters.
    Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a design of alearning environment
    for a novice learner to acquire an accurate fingerposition skill. For achieving
    the aim, we developed a learning environmentwhich can diagnose learner''s finger
    position and give the learner advice byusing magnetic position sensors. The system
    shows three windows; a fingerposition window for visualization of finger position,
    a score window fordiagnosing finger position along the score and command prompt
    window forshowing states of system and advices. Finally, we evaluated the system
    by anexperiment. The experimental group improved accuracy values about fingerpositions
    and also improved accuracy of pitches of sounds compared withcontrol group. These
    results shows significant differences.'

  abstract: 'This work presents a general framework method for cre-ating spatialization
    systems focused on electroacoustic andacousmatic music performance and creation.
    Although weused the logistic equation as orbit generator, any dynami-cal system
    could be suitable. The main idea lies on generating vectors of Rn with entriesfrom
    data series of di_x000B_erent orbits from an speci_x000C_c dynami-cal system.
    Such vectors will be called system vectors. Ourproposal is to create ordered paths
    between those pointsor system vectors using the Splines Quark library by Felix,1which
    allow us to generate smooth curves joining the points.Finally, interpolating that
    result with a _x000C_xed sample value,we are able to obtain speci_x000C_c and
    independent multidimen-sional panning trajectories for each speaker array and
    forany number of sound sources.Our contribution is intended to be at the very
    root of the compositionalprocess giving to the creator a method for exploring
    new ways for spatialsound placement over time for a wide range of speakers ar-rangements.
    The advantage of using controlled chaotic dy-namical systems like the logistic
    equation, lies on the factthat the composer can freely and consciously choose
    be-tween stable or irregular behaviour for the orbits that willgenerate his/her
    panning trajectories. Besides, with the useof isometries, it is possible to generate
    di_x000B_erent related or-bits with one single evaluation of the system. The use
    ofthe spline method in SuperCollider allows the possibilityof joining and relating
    those values from orbits into a wellde_x000C_ned and coherent general system.
    Further research willinclude controlling synthesis parameters in the same waywe
    created panning trajectories.'

    The mixing interface uses a stage metaphor mapping scheme where audio channels
    arerepresented as digital widgets on a 2D surface. These can be controlled bymulti
    touch or by smart tangibles, which are tangible blocks with embedded sensors.
    The smart tangibles developed for this interface are able to sense howthey are

    the smart tangible as well as a preliminary user study involving a hands-on focus
    group session where 5 different control technologiesare contrasted and discussed.
    Preliminary findings suggest that smart tangibles were preferred, but that an
    optimal interface would include a combination of touch, smart tangibles and an
    extra function control tangible for extending the functionality of the smart tangibles.
    Finally, the interface should incorporate both an edit and mix mode---the latter
    displaying very limited visual feedback in order to force users to focus their

  abstract: 'This paper presents an innovative digital musical instrument, the Illusio,
    based on an augmented multi-touch interface that combines a traditional multi-touch
    surface and a device similar to a guitar pedal. Illusio allows users to perform
    by drawing and by associating the sketches with live loops. These loops are manipulated
    based on a concept called hierarchical live looping, which extends traditional
    live looping through the use of a musical tree, in which any music operation applied
    to a given node affects all its children nodes. Finally, we evaluate the instrument
    considering the performer and the audience, which are two of the most important
    stakeholders involved in the use, conception, and perception of a musical device.
    The results achieved are encouraging and led to useful insights about how to improve
    instrument features, performance and usability.'

  abstract: 'In the design of recent systems, I have advanced techniques that positiongraphic
    synthesis methods in the context of solo, improvisational performance.Here, the
    primary interfaces for musical action are prepared works on paper,scanned by digital
    video cameras which in turn pass image data on to softwarefor analysis and interpretation
    as sound synthesis and signal processingprocedures. The focus of this paper is
    on one of these techniques, a process Idescribe as graphic waveshaping. A discussion
    of graphic waveshaping in basicform and as utilized in my performance work, (title
    omitted), is offered. Inthe latter case, the performer''s objective is to guide
    the interpretation ofimages as sound, constantly tuning and retuning the conversion
    while selectingand scanning images from a large catalog. Due to the erratic nature
    of thesystem and the precondition that image to sound relationships are unfixed,
    theperformance situation is replete with the discovery of new sounds and thecircumstances
    that bring them into play. Graphic waveshaping may be understood as non-linear
    distortion synthesis withtime-varying transfer functions stemming from visual
    scan lines. As a form ofgraphic synthesis, visual images function as motivations
    for sound generation.There is a strategy applied for creating one out of the other.
    However, counterto compositionally oriented forms of graphic synthesis where one
    may assignimage characteristics to musical parameters such as pitches, durations,dynamics,
    etc., graphic waveshaping is foremost a processing technique, as itdistorts incoming
    signals according to graphically derived transfer functions.As such, it may also
    be understood as an audio effect; one that in myimplementations is particularly
    feedback dependent, oriented towards shapingthe erratic behavior of synthesis
    patches written in Max/MSP/Jitter. Used inthis manner, graphic waveshaping elicits
    an emergent system behaviorconditioned by visual features.'

    effective methods to design nearly optimal filters forreal-time applications.
    However, to be able to design suitable filters for ourtarget application, it is

    we want to filter. This will again allow us todetermine a reasonable cutoff frequency
    for the filters. We have thereforeconducted an experiment in which we recorded
    the hand motion of 20 subjects.The frequency spectra of these data together with
    a method similar to theresidual analysis method were then used to determine reasonable
    cutofffrequencies. Based on this experiment, we propose three cutoff frequencies
    fordifferent scenarios and filtering needs: 5, 10 and 15 Hz, which corresponds
    toheavy, medium and light filtering respectively. Finally, we propose a range
    ofreal-time filters applicable to motion controllers. In particular, low-passfilters

    latent-states models. A music performance can be described with compositional
    and expressive properties varying over time. In those property changes we often
    observe particular patterns, and such a pattern can be understood as a "gesture",
    since it serves as a medium transferring specific emotions. Assuming a finite
    number of latent states on each property value changes, we can describe those
    gestures with statistical latent-states models, and train them by unsupervised
    learning algorithms. In addition, model entropy provides us a measure for different
    effects of each properties on the gesture implementation. Test result on some
    of real performances indicates that the trained models could capture the structure
    of gestures observed in the given performances, and detect their boundaries. The
    entropy-based measure was informative to understand the effectiveness of each

  abstract: 'This paper explores the potential of near-field optical reflective sensing
    formusical instrument gesture capture. Near-field optical sensors are inexpensive,portable
    and non-intrusive, and their high spatial and temporal resolutionmakes them ideal
    for tracking the finer motions of instrumental performance.The paper discusses
    general optical sensor performance with detailedinvestigations of three sensor
    models. An application is presented to violinbow position tracking using reflective
    sensors mounted on the stick. Bowtracking remains a difficult task, and many existing
    solutions are expensive,bulky, or offer limited temporal resolution. Initial results
    indicate that bowposition and pressure can be derived from optical measurements
    of thehair-string distance, and that similar techniques may be used to measure
    bowtilt.'

  abstract: 'Few formal methods exist for evaluating digital musical instruments (DMIs)
    .This paper proposes a novel method of DMI evaluation using crowd-sourcedtagging.
    One of the challenges in devising such methods is that the evaluationof a musical
    instrument is an inherently qualitative task. While previouslyproposed methods
    have focused on quantitative methods and largely ignored thequalitative aspects
    of the task, tagging is well-suited to this and is alreadyused to classify things
    such as websites and musical genres. These, like DMIs,do not lend themselves to
    simple categorization or parameterization. Using the social tagging method, participating
    individuals assign descriptivelabels, or tags, to a DMI. A DMI can then be evaluated
    by analyzing the tagsassociated with it. Metrics can be generated from the tags
    assigned to theinstrument, and comparisons made to other instruments. This can
    give thedesigner valuable insight into the where the strengths of the design lie
    andwhere improvements may be needed. A prototype system for testing the method
    is proposed in the paper and iscurrently being implemented as part of an ongoing
    DMI evaluation project. It isexpected that results from the prototype will be
    available to report by thetime of the conference in May.'

    rooted in the ancient art of poi spinning. The trajectory ofcircular motion drawn

    energetic and vibrant sound, which makesspiritual and meditative soundscape that
    opens everyone up the aura and clearsthe thought forms away. The mPoi project
    and its concepts will be introducedfirst and then its interaction with a performer
    will be discussed.The mPoi project seeks to develop a prototype for a set of mobile
    musicalinstrument based on electronic motion sensors and circuit boards. Thistechnology
    is installed in egg-shaped structure and allows communicationbetween a performer
    and the mPoi instrument. The principal motivation for themPoi project has been
    a desire to develop an extensible interface that willsupport the Poi performance,
    which is a style of performance art originatedwith the Maori people of New Zealand
    involving swinging tethered weightsthrough a variety of rhythmical and geometric
    patterns. As an extension of the body and the expansion of the movement, the mPoiutilizes
    the creative performance of Poi to make spatial and spiritual soundand music.
    The aims of the mPoi project are:to create a prototype of mPoi instrument that
    includes circuit board thatconnects the instrument to a sensor.to develop a software,
    which includes programming of the circuit board and forthe sound generation.to
    make a new artistic expression to refine the captured sound into artisticmusical
    notes. The creative part of the project is to design a unique method to translate
    theperformer''s gesture into sound. A unique algorithm was developed to extractfeatures
    of the swing motion and translate them into various patterns of sound.'

  abstract: 'The Internet allows musicians and other artists to collaborate remotely.However,
    network latency presents a fundamental challenge for remotecollaborators who need
    to coordinate and respond to each other''s performancein real time. In this paper,
    we investigate the viability of predictingpercussion hits before they have occurred,
    so that information about thepredicted drum hit can be sent over a network, and
    the sound can be synthesizedat a receiver''s location at approximately the same
    moment the hit occurs atthe sender''s location. Such a system would allow two
    percussionists to playin perfect synchrony despite the delays caused by computer
    networks. Toinvestigate the feasibility of such an approach, we record vibraphone
    malletstrikes with a high-speed camera and track the mallet head position. We
    showthat 30 ms before the strike occurs, it is possible to predict strike time
    andvelocity with acceptable accuracy. Our method fits a second-order polynomial
    tothe data to produce a strike time prediction that is within the bounds ofperceptual
    synchrony, and a velocity estimate that will enable the soundpressure level of
    the synthesized strike to be accurate within 3 dB.'

    be easy to install and remove by any trumpeter. Ourgoal is to offer the extended
    control afforded by hyperinstrumentswithout the hard to reverse or irreversible
    invasive modificationsthat are typically used for adding digital sensing capabilities.
    Weutilize optical sensors to track the continuous position displacementvalues
    of the three trumpet valves. These values are trasmittedwirelessly and can be
    used by an external controller. The hardware hasbeen designed to be reconfigurable
    by having the housing 3D printed sothat the dimensions can be adjusted for any
    particular trumpetmodel. The result is a low cost, low power, easily replicable
    sensorsolution that offers any trumpeter the ability to augment their ownexisting
    trumpet without compromising the instrument''s structure orplaying technique.
    The extended digital control afforded by our systemis interweaved with the natural

    The relative activity between different types of activity isassessed in order

    showed an overwhelming bias to thetechnological, followed by social investigations.
    An alternative classificationof survey product, or artifact reveals an increase
    in the number of productsdescribed with a corresponding decline in the number
    of surveys and artisticprojects. The increase in technical papers appears to be
    due to an enthusiasmto make use of increased capability of mobile phones, although

  abstract: 'Nowadays many music artists rely on visualisations and light shows to
    enhanceand augment their live performances. However, the visualisation and triggeringof
    lights is normally scripted in advance and synchronised with the concert,severely
    limiting the artist''s freedom for improvisation, expression and ad-hocadaptation
    of their show. These scripts result in performances where thetechnology enforces
    the artist and their music to stay in synchronisation withthe pre-programmed environment.
    We argue that these limitations can be overcomebased on emerging non-invasive
    tracking technologies in combination with anadvanced gesture recognition engine.We
    present a solution that uses explicit gestures and implicit dance moves tocontrol
    the visual augmentation of a live music performance. We furtherillustrate how
    our framework overcomes existing limitations of gestureclassification systems
    by delivering a precise recognition solution based on asingle gesture sample in
    combination with expert knowledge. The presentedsolution enables a more dynamic
    and spontaneous performance and, when combinedwith indirect augmented reality,
    results in a more intense interaction betweenthe artist and their audience.'

    left to right, and to relay information about volume, frequency content,noisiness,
    or potentially any analysable parameter back to the subject throughforces acting
    on their hand. General practicalities of mapping sonic elements to physical forces
    areconsidered, such as the problem of representing detailed data through vaguephysical
    sensation, approaches to applying forces to the hand that do notinterfering with
    the smooth operation of the device, and the relative merits ofdiscreet and continuous
    mappings. Three approaches to generating the forcevector are discussed: 1) the
    use of simulated detents to identify areas of anaudio parameter over a certain
    threshold, 2) applying friction proportional tothe level of the audio parameter
    along the axis of movement, and 3) creatingforces perpendicular to the subject''s

  abstract: 'Since Euler''s development of the Tonnetz in 1739, musicians, composers
    and instrument designers have been fascinated with the concept of musicalisomorphism,
    the idea that by arranging tones by their harmonic relationships rather than by
    their physical properties, the common shapes of musical constructs will appear,
    facilitating learning and new ways of exploring harmonic spaces. The construction
    of isomorphic instruments, beyond limited square isomorphisms present in many
    stringed instruments, has been a challenge in the past for two reasons: The first
    problem, that of re-arranging note actuators from their sounding elements, has
    been solved by digital instrument design. The second, more conceptual problem,
    is that only a single isomorphism can be designed for any one instrument, requiring
    the instrument designer (as well as composer and performer) to "lock in" to a
    single isomorphism, or to have a different instrument for each isomorphism in
    order to experiment. Musix (an iOS application) and Rainboard (a physical device)
    are two new musical instruments built to overcome this and other limitations of
    existing isomorphic instruments. Musix was developed to allow experimentation
    with a wide variety of different isomorphic layouts, to assess the advantages
    and disadvantages of each. The Rainboard consists of a hexagonal array of arcade
    buttons embedded with RGB-LEDs, which are used to indicate characteristics of
    the isomorphism currently in use on the Rainboard. The creation of these two instruments/experimentation
    platforms allows for isomorphic layouts to be explored in waysthat are not possible
    with existing instruments.'

  abstract: 'For a number of years, musicians in different locations have been able
    toperform with one another over a network as though present on the same stage.However,
    rather than attempt to re-create an environment for Network MusicPerformance (NMP)
    that mimics co-present performance as closely as possible, wepropose focusing
    on providing musicians with additional controls that can helpincrease the level
    of interaction between them. To this end, we have developeda reactive environment
    for distributed performance that provides participantsdynamic, real-time control
    over several aspects of their performance, enablingthem to change volume levels
    and experience exaggerated stereo panning. Inaddition, our reactive environment
    reinforces a feeling of a ``shared space'''' between musicians. It differs most
    notably from standard ventures into thedesign of novel musical interfaces and
    installations in its reliance onuser-centric methodologies borrowed from the field
    of Human-ComputerInteraction (HCI). Not only does this research enable us to closely
    examine thecommunicative aspects of performance, it also allows us to explore
    newinterpretations of the network as a performance space. This paper describes
    themotivation and background behind our project, the work that has been undertakentowards
    its realization and the future steps that have yet to be explored.'

  abstract: 'This paper explores working methods and instrument design for musical
    performance sessions (studio and live) where cross-adaptive techniques for audio
    processing are utilized.  Cross-adaptive processing uses feature extraction methods
    and digital processing to allow the actions of one acoustic instrument to influence
    the timbre of another. Even though the physical interface for the musician is
    the familiar acoustic instrument, the musical dimensions controlled with the actions
    on the instrument have been expanded radically. For this reason, and when used
    in live performance, the cross-adaptive methods constitute new interfaces for
    musical expression. Not only do the musician control his or her own instrumental
    expression, but the instrumental actions directly influence the timbre of another
    instrument in the ensemble, while their own instrument''s sound is modified by
    the actions of other musicians. In the present paper we illustrate and discuss
    some design issues relating to the configuration and composition of such tools
    for different musical situations. Such configurations include among other things
    the mapping of modulators, the choice of applied effects and processing methods.'

    sound installation environments for collective musical expression. We collected
    interview evidence about the participants'' experience and analysed the data with

    that re-physicalizes the Whirlwind meta-wind-instrument physical model. We re-implemented
    the Whirlwind by using real-world physical objects to comprise a sound installation.
    The sound propagation between a speaker and microphone was used as the delay,
    and a paper cylinder was employed as the resonator. This paper explains the concept

  abstract: Many common and popular sound spatialisation techniques and methods rely
    on listeners being positioned in a "sweet-spot" for an optimal listening position
    in a circle of speakers. This paper discusses a stochastic spatialisation method
    and its first iteration as implemented for the exhibition Hot Pocket at The Museum
    of Contemporary Art in Oslo in 2017. This method is implemented in Max and offers
    a matrix-based amplitude panning methodology which can provide a flexible means
    for the spatialialisation of sounds.

  abstract: 'AM MODE is a custom-designed software interface for electronic augmentation
    of the acoustic drum set. The software is used in the development a series of
    recordings, similarly titled as AM MODE. Programmed in Max/MSP, the software uses
    live audio input from individual instruments within the drum set as control parameters
    for modulation synthesis. By using a combination of microphones and MIDI triggers,
    audio signal features such as the velocity of the strike of the drum, or the frequency
    at which the drum resonates, are tracked, interpolated, and scaled to user specifications.
    The resulting series of recordings is comprised of the digitally generated output
    of the modulation engine, in addition to both raw and modulated signals from the
    acoustic drum set. In this way, this project explores drum set augmentation not
    only at the input and from a performative angle, but also at the output, where
    the acoustic and the synthesized elements are merged into each other, forming
    a sonic hybrid.  '

  abstract: 'This paper presents a study examining the effects of disfluent design
    on audience perception of digital musical instrument (DMI) performance. Disfluency,
    defined as a barrier to effortless cognitive processing, has been shown to generate
    better results in some contexts as it engages higher levels of cognition. We were
    motivated to determine if disfluent design in a DMI would result in a risk state
    that audiences would be able to perceive, and if this would have any effect on
    their evaluation of the performance. A DMI was produced that incorporated a disfluent
    characteristic: It would turn itself off if not constantly moved. Six physically
    identical instruments were produced, each in one of three versions: Control (no
    disfluent characteristics), mild disfluency (turned itself off slowly), and heightened
    disfluency (turned itself off more quickly). 6 percussionists each performed on
    one instrument for a live audience (N=31), and data was collected in the form
    of real-time feedback (via a mobile phone app), and post-hoc surveys. Though there
    was little difference in ratings of enjoyment between the versions of the instrument,
    the real-time and qualitative data suggest that disfluent behaviour in a DMI may
    be a way for audiences to perceive and appreciate performer skill.'

  abstract: 'The voice of the theremin is more than just a simple sine wave. Its unique
    sound is made through two radio frequency oscillators that, when operating at
    almost identical frequencies, gravitate towards each other. Ultimately, this pull
    alters the sine wave, creating the signature sound of the theremin. The Theremin
    Textural Expander (TTE) explores other textures the theremin can produce when
    its sound is processed and manipulated through a Max/MSP patch and controlled
    via a MIDI pedalboard. The TTE extends the theremin''s ability, enabling it to
    produce five distinct new textures beyond the original.  It also features a looping
    system that the performer can use to layer textures created with the traditional
    theremin sound. Ultimately, this interface introduces a new way to play and experience
    the theremin; it extends its expressivity, affording a greater range of compositional
    possibilities and greater flexibility in free improvisation contexts.   '

    physically excite surfaces in the environment and capture resultant signals.  Input
    materials are then processed using a novel application of Karplus-Strong synthesis,
    in which these impulses are imbued with discrete resonances.  We achieved gestural
    control over synthesis parameters using a secondary tactile interface, consisting
    of four force-sensitive resistors (FSR), a fader, and momentary switch.  As a
    unique feature of our instrument, we modeled pitch organization and associated
    parametric controls according to theoretical principles outlined in Harry Partch''s

    udentities, and a variable numerary nexus.  This system classifies pitch content

  abstract: 'Robotic instrument designers tend to focus on the number of sound control
    parameters and their resolution when trying to develop expressivity in their instruments.
    These parameters afford greater sonic nuance related to elements of music that
    are traditionally associated with expressive human performances including articulation,
    timbre, dynamics, and phrasing. Equating the capacity for sonic nuance and musical
    expression stems from the “transitive” perspective that musical expression is
    an act of emotional communication from performer to listener. However, this perspective
    is problematic in the case of robotic instruments since we do not typically consider
    machines to be capable of expressing emotion. Contemporary theories of musical
    expression focus on an “intransitive” perspective, where musical meaning is generated
    as an embodied experience. Understanding expressivity from this perspective allows
    listeners to interpret performances by robotic instruments as possessing their
    own expressive meaning, even though the performer is a machine. It also enables
    musicians working with robotic instruments to develop their own unique vocabulary
    of expressive gestures unique to mechanical instruments. This paper explores these
    issues of musical expression, introducing the concept of mechatronic expression
    as a compositional and design strategy that highlights the musical and performative
    capabilities unique to robotic instruments.'

  abstract: 'Chunity is a programming environment for the design of interactive audiovisual
    games, instruments, and experiences. It embodies an audio-driven, sound-first
    approach that integrates audio programming and graphics programming in the same
    workflow, taking advantage of strongly-timed audio programming features of the
    ChucK programming language and the state-of-the-art real-time graphics engine
    found in Unity. We describe both the system and its intended workflow for the
    creation of expressive audiovisual works. Chunity was evaluated as the primary
    software platform in a computer music and design course, where students created
    a diverse assortment of interactive audiovisual software. We present results from
    the evaluation and discuss Chunity''s usability, utility, and aesthetics as a
    way of working. Through these, we argue for Chunity as a unique and useful way
    to program sound, graphics, and interaction in tandem, giving users the flexibility
    to use a game engine to do much more than "just" make games.'

  abstract: 'In this paper we expand on prior research into the use of Continuous
    Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs) as evolvable generators of musical structures
    such as audio waveforms. This type of neural network has a compact structure and
    is capable of producing a large range of temporal dynamics. Due to these properties,
    we believe that CTRNNs combined with evolutionary algorithms (EA) could offer
    musicians many creative possibilities for the exploration of sound. In prior work,
    we have explored the use of interactive and target-based EA designs to tap into
    the creative possibilities of CTRNNs. Our results have shown promise for the use
    of CTRNNs in the audio domain. However, we feel neither EA designs allow both
    open-ended discovery and effective navigation of the CTRNN audio search space
    by musicians. Within this paper, we explore the possibility of using novelty search
    as an alternative algorithm that facilitates both open-ended and rapid discovery
    of the CTRNN creative search space.'

  abstract: 'Research into machine listening has intensified in recent years creating
    a variety of techniques for recognising musical features suitable, for example,
    in musicological analysis or commercial application in song recognition. Within
    NIME, several projects exist seeking to make these techniques useful in real-time
    music making. However, we debate whether the functionally-oriented approaches
    inherited from engineering domains that much machine listening research manifests
    is fully suited to the exploratory, divergent, boundary-stretching, uncertainty-seeking,
    playful and irreverent orientations of many artists. To explore this, we engaged
    in a concerted collaborative design exercise in which many different listening
    algorithms were implemented and presented with input which challenged their customary
    range of application and the implicit norms of musicality which research can take
    for granted. An immersive 3D spatialised multichannel environment was created
    in which the algorithms could be explored in a hybrid installation/performance/lecture
    form of research presentation. The paper closes with reflections on the creative
    value of ‘hijacking'' formal approaches into deviant contexts, the typically undocumented
    practical know-how required to make algorithms work, the productivity of a playfully
    irreverent relationship between engineering and artistic approaches to NIME, and
    a sketch of a sonocybernetic aesthetics for our work.'

  abstract: 'Machine learning and deep learning has recently made a large impact in
    the artistic community. In many of these applications however, the model is often
    used to render the high dimensional output directly e.g. every individual pixel
    in the final image. Humans arguably operate in much lower dimensional spaces during
    the creative process e.g. the broad movements of a brush. In this paper, we design
    a neural gesture system for music generation based around this concept. Instead
    of directly generating audio, we train a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent
    neural network to generate instantaneous position and pressure on the Roli Lightpad
    instrument. These generated coordinates in turn, give rise to the sonic output
    defined in the synth engine.  The system relies on learning these movements from
    a musician who has already developed a palette of musical gestures idiomatic to
    the Lightpad. Unlike many deep learning systems that render high dimensional output,
    our low-dimensional system can be run in real-time, enabling the first real time
    gestural duet of its kind between a player and a recurrent neural network on the
    Lightpad instrument.'

  abstract: 'Many digital interfaces for audio effects still resemble racks and cases
    of their hardware counterparts. For instance, DSP-algorithms are often adjusted
    via direct value input, sliders, or knobs. While recent research has started to
    experiment with the capabilities offered by modern interfaces, there are no examples
    for productive applications such as audio-morphing. Audio-morphing as a special
    field of DSP has a high complexity for the morph itself and for the parametrization
    of the transition between two sources. We propose a multi-touch enhanced interface
    for visual audiomorphing. This interface visualizes the internal processing and
    allows direct manipulation of the morphing parameters in the visualization. Using
    multi-touch gestures to manipulate audio-morphing in a visual way, sound design
    and music production becomes more unrestricted and creative.'

  abstract: 'Traditional instrument learning procedure is time-consuming; it begins
    with learning music notations and necessitates layers of sophistication and abstraction.
    Haptic interfaces open another door to the music world for the vast majority of
    talentless beginners when traditional training methods are not effective. However,
    the existing haptic interfaces can only be used to learn specially designed pieces
    with great restrictions on duration and pitch range due to the fact that it is
    only feasible to guide a part of performance motion haptically for most instruments.
    Our study breaks such restrictions using a semi-haptic guidance method. For the
    first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces go beyond an octave
    (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration
    of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. This significant change leads to a more
    realistic instrument learning process. Experiments show that semi-haptic interface
    is effective as long as learners are not “tone deaf”. Using our prototype device,
    the learning rate is about 30% faster compared with learning from videos.'

  abstract: 'The term `NIME'' --- New Interfaces for Musical Expression --- has come
    to signify both technical and cultural characteristics. Not all new musical instruments
    are NIMEs, and not all NIMEs are defined as such for the sole ephemeral condition
    of being new. So, what are the typical characteristics of NIMEs and what are their
    roles in performers'' practice? Is there a typical NIME repertoire? This paper
    aims to address these questions with a bottom up approach. We reflect on the answers
    of 78 NIME performers to an online questionnaire discussing their performance
    experience with NIMEs. The results of our investigation explore the role of NIMEs
    in the performers'' practice and identify the values that are common among performers.
    We find that most NIMEs are viewed as exploratory tools created by and for performers,
    and that they are constantly in development and almost in no occasions in a finite
    state. The findings of our survey also reflect upon virtuosity with NIMEs, whose
    peculiar performance practice results in learning trajectories that often do not
    lead to the development of virtuosity as it is commonly understood in traditional

  abstract: 'An oft-cited aspiration of digital musical instrument (DMI) design is
    to create instruments, in the words of Wessel and Wright, with a ‘low entry fee
    and no ceiling on virtuosity''. This is a difficult task to achieve: many new
    instruments are aimed at either the expert or amateur musician, with few instruments
    catering for both. There is often a balance between learning curve and the nuance
    of musical control in DMIs. In this paper we present a study conducted with non-musicians
    and guitarists playing guitar-derivative DMIs with variable levels of control
    intimacy: how the richness and nuance of a performer''s movement translates into
    the musical output of an instrument. Findings suggest a significant difference
    in preference for levels of control intimacy between the guitarists and the non-musicians.
    In particular, the guitarists unanimously preferred the richest of the two settings
    whereas the non-musicians generally preferred the setting with lower richness.
    This difference is notable because it is often taken as a given that increasing
    richness is a way to make instruments more enjoyable to play, however, this result
    only seems to be true for expert players.'

  abstract: This paper describes the process of developing a standstill performance
    work using the Myo gesture control armband and the Bela embedded computing platform.
    The combination of Myo and Bela allows a portable and extensible version of the
    standstill performance concept while introducing muscle tension as an additional
    control parameter.  We describe the technical details of our setup and introduce
    Myo-to-Bela and Myo-to-OSC software bridges that assist with prototyping compositions
    using the Myo controller.

  abstract: This paper explores the use of the ubiquitous MIDI keyboard to control
    a DJ performance system. The prototype system uses a two octave keyboard with
    each octave controlling one audio track. Each audio track has four two-bar loops
    which play in synchronisation switchable by its respective octave's first four
    black keys. The top key of the keyboard toggles between frequency filter mode
    and time slicer mode. In frequency filter mode the white keys provide seven bands
    of latched frequency filtering. In time slicer mode the white keys plus black
    B flat key provide latched on/off control of eight time slices of the loop. The
    system was informally evaluated by nine subjects. The frequency filter mode combined
    with loop switching worked well with the MIDI keyboard interface. All subjects
    agreed that all tools had creative performance potential that could be developed
    by further practice.

    such system to use CPGs for interactive rhythm creation. We discuss how Neurythmic
    uses the entrainment behaviour of these networks to support the creation of rhythms
    while avoiding the rigidity of grid quantisation approaches. As well as discussing
    the development, design and evaluation of Neurythmic, we discuss relevant properties

  abstract: 'Composing music typically requires years of music theory experience and
    knowledge that includes but is not limited to chord progression, melody composition
    theory, and an understanding of whole-step/half-step passing tones among others.
    For that reason, certain songwriters such as singers may find a necessity to hire
    experienced pianists to help compose their music. In order to facilitate the process
    for beginner and aspiring musicians, we have developed Lumanote, a music composition
    tool that aids songwriters by presenting real-time suggestions on appropriate
    melody notes and chord progression. While a preliminary evaluation yielded favorable
    results for beginners, many commented on the difficulty of having to map the note
    suggestions displayed on the on-screen interface to the physical keyboard they
    were playing on. This paper presents the resulting solution: an LED-based feedback
    system that is designed to be directly attached to any standard MIDI keyboard.
    This peripheral aims to help map note suggestions directly to the physical keys
    of a musical keyboard. A study consisting of 22 individuals was conducted to compare
    the effectiveness of the new LED-based system with the existing computer interface,
    finding that the vast majority of users preferred the LED system. Three experienced
    musicians also judged and ranked the compositions, noting significant improvement
    in song quality when using either system, and citing comparable quality between
    compositions that used either interface.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes a machine learning approach in the context of non-idiomatic
    human-machine improvisation. In an attempt to avoid explicit mapping of user actions
    to machine responses, an experimental machine learning strategy is suggested where
    rewards are derived from the implied motivation of the human interactor – two
    motivations are at work: integration (aiming to connect with machine generated
    material) and expression (independent activity). By tracking consecutive changes
    in musical distance (i.e. melodic similarity) between human and machine, such
    motivations can be inferred. A variation of Q-learning is used featuring a self-optimizing
    variable length state-action-reward list. The system (called Pock) is tunable
    into particular behavioral niches by means of a limited number of parameters.
    Pock is designed as a recursive structure and behaves as a complex dynamical system.
    When tracking systems variables over time, emergent non-trivial patterns reveal
    experimental evidence of attractors demonstrating successful adaptation.'

    part of the gesture. A number of sensor types can be used to capture information
    about hand posture, each of which has various practical advantages and disadvantages

  abstract: 'Laptop orchestras create music, although digitally produced, in a collaborative
    live performance not unlike a traditional orchestra. The recent increase in interest
    and investment in this style of music creation has paved the way for novel methods
    for musicians to create and interact with music. To this end, a number of nontraditional
    instruments have been constructed that enable musicians to control sound production
    beyond pitch and volume, integrating filtering, musical effects, etc. Wii Remotes
    (WiiMotes) have seen heavy use in maker communities, including laptop orchestras,
    for their robust sensor array and low cost. The placement of sensors and the form
    factor of the device itself are suited for video games, not necessarily live music
    creation. In this paper, the authors present a new controller design, based on
    the WiiMote hardware platform, to address usability in gesture-centric music performance.
    Based on the pilot-study data, the new controller offers unrestricted two-hand
    gesture production, smaller footprint, and lower muscle strain.'

  abstract: 'In digital musical instrument design, different tools and methods offer
    a variety of approaches for constraining the exploration of musical gestures and
    sounds. Toolkits made of modular components usefully constrain exploration towards
    simple, quick and functional combinations, and methods such as sketching and model-making
    alternatively allow imagination and narrative to guide exploration. In this work
    we sought to investigate a context where these approaches to exploration were
    combined. We designed a craft workshop for 20 musical instrument designers, where
    groups were given the same partly-finished instrument to craft for one hour with
    raw materials, and though the task was open ended, they were prompted to focus
    on subtle details that might distinguish their instruments. Despite the prompt
    the groups diverged dramatically in intent and style, and generated gestural language
    rapidly and flexibly. By the end, each group had developed a distinctive approach
    to constraint, exploratory style, collaboration and interpretation of the instrument
    and workshop materials. We reflect on this outcome to discuss advantages and disadvantages
    to integrating digital musical instrument design tools and methods, and how to
    further investigate and extend this approach.'

    shape based on models of geometric chaos for stadium shaped boundaries. This provides
    a proof-of-concept that this robotic fabrication technique might be a candidate
    method for creating novel metallic ideophones that are based on sheet deformations.
    Given that the technique does not require molding, it is well suited for both
    rapid and iterative prototyping and the fabrication of individual pieces. With
    advances in miniaturization, this approach may also be suitable for personal fabrication.

  abstract: 'The design of traditional musical instruments is a process of incremental
    refinement over many centuries of innovation. Conversely, digital musical instruments
    (DMIs), being unconstrained by requirements of efficient acoustic sound production
    and ergonomics, can take on forms which are more abstract in their relation to
    the mechanism of control and sound production. In this paper we consider the case
    of designing DMIs for use in existing musical cultures, and pose questions around
    the social and technical acceptability of certain design choices relating to global
    physical form and input modality (sensing strategy and the input gestures that
    it affords). We designed four guitar-derivative DMIs designed to be suitable to
    perform a strummed harmonic accompaniment to a folk tune. Each instrument possessed
    varying degrees of `guitar-likeness'', based either on the form and aesthetics
    of the guitar or the specific mode of interaction. We conducted a study where
    both non-musicians and guitarists played two versions of the instruments and completed
    musical tasks with each instrument. The results of this study highlight the complex
    interaction between global form and input modality when designing for existing
    musical cultures.'

    played 20 sessions despite system latency and reduced musical expression. He incorporated
    his own literature and equipment into his playing routine and improved greatly
    as the study progressed. He was able to play alone and keep a steady rhythm in

  abstract: 'This paper covers the technical and aesthetic development of robotcowboy,
    the author''s ongoing human-computer wearable performance project. Conceived as
    an idiosyncratic manifesto on the embodiment of computational sound, the original
    robotcowboy system was built in 2006-2007 using a belt-mounted industrial wearable
    computer running GNU/Linux and Pure Data, external USB audio/MIDI interfaces,
    HID gamepads, and guitar. Influenced by roadworthy analog gear, chief system requirements
    were mobility, plug-and-play, reliability, and low cost. From 2007 to 2011, this
    first iteration "Cabled Madness" melded rock music with realtime algorithmic composition
    and revolved around cyborg human/system tension, aspects of improvisation, audience
    feedback, and an inherent capability of failure. The second iteration "Onward
    to Mars" explored storytelling from 2012-2015 through the one-way journey of the
    first human on Mars with the computing system adapted into a self-contained spacesuit
    backpack. Now 10 years on, a new {robotcowboy 2.0} system powers a third iteration
    with only an iPhone and PdParty, the author''s open-source iOS application which
    runs Pure Data patches and provides full duplex stereo audio, MIDI, HID game controller

  abstract: 'This article describes the design and construction of a collection of
    digitally-controlled augmented acoustic guitars, and the use of these guitars
    in the installation \textit\{Sverm-Resonans\}. The installation was built around
    the idea of exploring `inverse'' sonic microinteraction, that is, controlling
    sounds by the micromotion observed when attempting to stand still. It consisted
    of six acoustic guitars, each equipped with a Bela embedded computer for sound
    processing (in Pure Data), an infrared distance sensor to detect the presence
    of users, and an actuator attached to the guitar body to produce sound. With an
    attached battery pack, the result was a set of completely autonomous instruments
    that were easy to hang in a gallery space. The installation encouraged explorations
    on the boundary between the tactile and the kinesthetic, the body and the mind,
    and between motion and sound. The use of guitars, albeit with an untraditional
    `performance'' technique, made the experience both familiar and unfamiliar at
    the same time. Many users reported heightened sensations of stillness, sound,
    and vibration, and that the `inverse'' control of the instrument was both challenging
    and pleasant.'

  abstract: 'We developed a new musical interface, CubeHarmonic, with the magnetic
    tracking system, IM3D, created at Tohoku University. IM3D system precisely tracks
    positions of tiny, wireless, battery-less, and identifiable LC coils in real time.
    The CubeHarmonic is a musical application of the Rubik''s cube, with notes on
    each little piece. Scrambling the cube, we get different chords and chord sequences.
    Positions of the pieces which contain LC coils are detected through IM3D, and
    transmitted to the computer, that plays sounds. The central position of the cube
    is also computed from the LC coils located into the corners of Rubik''s cube,
    and, depending on the computed central position, we can manipulate overall loudness
    and pitch changes, as in theremin playing. This new instrument, whose first idea
    comes from mathematical theory of music, can be used as a teaching tool both for
    math (group theory) and music (music theory, mathematical music theory), as well
    as a composition device, a new instrument for avant-garde performances, and a
    recreational tool.'

  abstract: 'In this paper we present a novel digital effects controller for electric
    guitar based upon the whammy bar as a user interface. The goal with the project
    is to give guitarists a way to interact with dynamic effects control that feels
    familiar to their instrument and playing style. A 3D-printed prototype has been
    made. It replaces the whammy bar of a traditional Fender vibrato system with a
    sensor-equipped whammy bar. The functionality of the present prototype includes
    separate readings of force applied towards and from the guitar body, as well as
    an end knob for variable control. Further functionality includes a hinged system
    allowing for digital effect control either with or without the mechanical manipulation
    of string tension. By incorporating digital sensors to the idiomatic whammy bar
    interface, one would potentially bring guitarists a high level of control intimacy
    with the device, and thus lead to a closer interaction with effects.'

  abstract: 'The process of learning to play a string instrument is a notoriously
    difficult task. A new student to the instrument is faced with mastering multiple,
    interconnected physical movements in order to become a skillful player. In their
    development, one measure of a players quality is their tone, which is the result
    of the combination of the physical characteristics of the instrument and their
    technique in playing it. This paper describes preliminary research into creating
    an intuitive, real-time device for evaluating the quality of tone generation on
    the cello: a ``timbre-tuner'''' to aid cellists evaluate their tone quality. Data
    for the study was collected from six post-secondary music students, consisting
    of recordings of scales covering the entire range of the cello. Comprehensive
    spectral audio analysis was performed on the data set in order to evaluate features
    suitable to describe tone quality. An inverse relationship was found between the
    harmonic centroid and pitch played, which became more pronounced when restricted
    to the A string. In addition, a model for predicting the harmonic centroid at
    different pitches on the A string was created. Results from informal listening
    tests support the use of the harmonic centroid as an appropriate measure for tone
    quality.'

  abstract: 'The recent increase in the accessibility and size of personal and crowdsourced
    digital sound collections brought about a valuable resource for music creation.
    Finding and retrieving relevant sounds in performance leads to challenges that
    can be approached using music information retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we explore
    the use of MIR to retrieve and repurpose sounds in musical live coding. We present
    a live coding system built on SuperCollider enabling the use of audio content
    from online Creative Commons (CC) sound databases such as Freesound or personal
    sound databases. The novelty of our approach lies in exploiting high-level MIR
    methods (e.g., query by pitch or rhythmic cues) using live coding techniques applied
    to sounds. We demonstrate its potential through the reflection of an illustrative
    case study and the feedback from four expert users. The users tried the system
    with either a personal database or a crowdsourced database and reported its potential
    in facilitating tailorability of the tool to their own creative workflows.'

    systems that facilitate improvisation where the musicians can interact not just
    by listening to each other and changing their own output, but also by manipulating
    the data stream of the other performer(s). In a course of performance-led research
    four prototypes were built and analyzed them using concepts from NIME and creative
    collaboration literature. Based on this analysis it was found that the systems
    should 1) provide a commonly modifiable visual representation of musical data
    for both coder and non-coder, and 2) provide some independent means of sound production
    for each user, giving the non-coder the ability to slow down and make non-realtime
    decisions for greater performance flexibility. '

  abstract: 'This paper explores the role of materiality in Digital Musical Instruments
    and questions the influence of tacit understandings of sensor technology. Existing
    research investigates the use of gesture, physical interaction and subsequent
    parameter mapping. We suggest that a tacit knowledge of the ‘sensor layer'' brings
    with it definitions, understandings and expectations that forge and guide our
    approach to interaction. We argue that the influence of technology starts before
    a sound is made, and comes from not only intuition of material properties, but
    also received notions of what technology can and should do. On encountering an
    instrument with obvious sensors, a potential performer will attempt to predict
    what the sensors do and what the designer intends for them to do, becoming influenced
    by a machine centered understanding of interaction and not a solely material centred
    one. The paper presents an observational study of interaction using non-functional
    prototype instruments designed to explore fundamental ideas and understandings
    of instrumental interaction in the digital realm. We will show that this understanding
    influences both gestural language and ability to characterise an expected sonic/musical
    response. '

  abstract: 'For the purpose of creating new musical instruments, chaotic dynamical
    systems can be simulated in real time to synthesize complex sounds.  This work
    investigates a series of discrete-time chaotic maps, which have the potential
    to generate intriguing sounds when they are adjusted to be on the edge of chaos.  With
    these chaotic maps as studied historically, the edge of chaos tends to be razor-thin,
    which can make it difficult to employ them for making new musical instruments.  The
    authors therefore suggest connecting chaotic maps with digital waveguides, which
    (1) make it easier to synthesize harmonic tones and (2) make it harder to fall
    off of the edge of chaos while playing a musical instrument.  The authors argue
    therefore that this technique widens the razor-thin edge of chaos into a musical

  abstract: 'In computer or electroacoustic music, it is often the case that the compositional
    act and the parametric control of the underlying synthesis algorithms or hardware
    are not separable from each other. In these situations, composition and control
    of the synthesis parameters are not easy to distinguish. One possible solution
    is by means of fuzzy logic. This approach provides a simple, intuitive but powerful
    control of the compositional process usually in interesting non-linear ways. Compositional
    control in this context is achieved by the fuzzification of the relevant internal
    synthesis parameters and the parallel computation of common sense fuzzy rules
    of inference specified by the composer. This approach has been implemented computationally
    as a software package entitled FLCTK (Fuzzy Logic Control Tool Kit) in the form
    of external objects for the widely used real-time compositional environments Max/MSP
    and Pd. In this article, we present an updated version of this tool. As a demonstration
    of the wide range of situations in which this approach could be used, we provide
    two examples of parametric fuzzy control: first, the fuzzy control of a water
    tank simulation and second a particle-based sound synthesis technique by a fuzzy

    that in general subjects'' timing variability is significantly affected when playing

  abstract: 'Measurement of pianists'' arm movement provides a signal,which is composed
    of controlled movements and noise. Thenoise is composed of uncontrolled movement
    generated bythe interaction of the arm with the piano action and measurement error.
    We propose a probabilistic model for armtouch movements, which allows to estimate
    the amount ofnoise in a joint. This estimation helps to interpret the movement
    signal, which is of interest for augmented piano andpiano pedagogy applications.'

  abstract: 'Haptic feedback is an important element that needs to be carefully designed
    in computer music interfaces. This paper presents an evaluation of several force
    renderings for target acquisition in space when used to support a music related
    task. The study presented here addresses only one musical aspect: the need to
    repeat elements accurately in time and in content. Several force scenarios will
    be rendered over a simple 3D target acquisition task and users'' performance will
    be quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. The results show how the users''
    subjective preference for a particular kind of force support does not always correlate
    to a quantitative measurement of performance enhancement. We describe a way in
    which a control mapping for a musical interface could be achieved without contradicting
    the users'' preferences as obtained from the study. '

    by translating cellular patterns of Conway''s Game of Life into musical scales.
    A performer can compose music by controlling varying cell patterns and sounds
    with visual and auditory fun. A performer assigns the elements of tone to two-dimensional
    cell patterns in the matrix of the Game of Life. Our system searches defined cell
    patterns in the varying matrix dynamically. If the patterns are matched, corresponding
    tones are generated. A performer can make cells in the matrix by moving in front
    of a camera and interactively influencing the generation of music. The progress
    of the Game of Life is controlled with a clock defined by the performer to configure
    the groove of the music. By running multiple matrices with different pattern mapping,
    clock timing, and instruments, we can perform an ensemble. The Life Game Orchestra

    a result of our research efforts, the Waseda Flutist Robot WF-4RIV and the Waseda

    As a long-term goal, we are proposing to enable the interaction between musical

    of humans within a band is a special case of conventional human social behavior.
    Rhythm, harmony and timbre of the music played represent the emotional states

    in such an interaction may contribute to the better understanding of some of the
    mechanisms that enable the communication of humans in musical terms. Therefore,
    we are not considering a musical performance robot (MPR) just as a mere sophisticated
    MIDI instrument. Instead, its human-like design and the integration of perceptual
    capabilities may enable to act on its own autonomous initiative based on models
    which consider its own physical constrains. In this paper, we present an overview

  abstract: 'This paper presents an interactive and improvisational jam session, including
    human players and two robotic musicians. The project was developed in an effort
    to create novel and inspiring music through human-robot collaboration. The jam
    session incorporates Shimon, a newly-developed socially-interactive robotic marimba
    player, and Haile, a perceptual robotic percussionist developed in previous work.
    The paper gives an overview of the musical perception modules, adaptive improvisation
    modes and human-robot musical interaction models that were developed for the session.
    The paper also addresses the musical output that can be created from increased
    interconnections in an expanded multiple-robot multiplehuman ensemble, and suggests
    directions for future work. '

  abstract: 'Tabletops—and by extension, tabletop computers— naturally facilitate
    group work. In particular, they provide a fascinating platform for exploring the
    possibilities of collaborative audio improvisation. Existing tabletop instruments
    (and digital instruments in general) tend to impose either a steep learning curve
    on novice players or a frustrating ceiling of expressivity upon experts. We introduce
    WallBalls, an intuitive tabletop instrument designed to support both novice and
    expert performance. At first glance, WallBalls resembles a toy, game or whimsical
    sketchpad, but it quickly reveals itself as a deeply expressive and highly adaptable
    sample-based instrument capable of facilitating a startling variety of collaborative

  abstract: 'This paper describes the inspiration and implementation of a tactile,
    tabletop synthesizer/step sequencer. The Tactus is an expandable and inexpensive
    musical interface for the creation of loop-based music inspired by the Bubblegum
    Sequencer [2]. An optical camera, coupled with a computer running Max/MSP/Jitter
    can turn almost any matrix-like object into a step sequencer. The empty cells
    in the gridded object are filled with a fitting, colored object; the placement
    of which is analogous to adding an instrument or switching on a box in a step
    sequencer grid. The color and column position of every element in the matrix are
    used as parameters for a synthesizer while the row position of that element corresponds
    to the moment within the loop that entry is sounded. The two dimensional array
    can be positioned anywhere within the camera''s visibility. Both the translation
    and rotation of the physical matrix are assigned to global parameters that affect
    the music while preserving the color and order of the cells. A rotation of 180
    degrees, for example, will not reverse the sequence, but instead change an assigned
    global parameter.'

    sound possibilities for stringinstruments by "listening" to the sounds of the
    instrument''sbody and extracting audio and data from the wood''sacoustic vibrations.
    A method for capturing, localizing andanalyzing the percussive hits on the instrument''s
    body ispresented, in connection with an audio-driven electronicpercussive sound
    module. The system introduces a newgesture-sound relationship in the electric
    string instrumentplaying environment, namely the use of percussivetechniques on
    the instrument''s body which are null inregular circumstances due to selective
    and exclusivemicrophone use for the strings. Instrument bodypercussions are widely

    through haptic manipulation ofthe instrument itself. The research work was carried

    within the Wii remote to capture the gestures of aconductor using a baton with
    an infrared LED and battery.Our system then performs data analysis with gesture
    classification and following, and finally displays the gestures using visual baton
    trajectories and audio feedback. Gesturetrajectories are displayed in real time
    and can be comparedto the corresponding diagram shown in a textbook. In addition,
    since a conductor normally does not look at a screenwhile conducting, tones are

  abstract: '''''Music for 32 Chess Pieces'''' is a software system that supports
    composing, performing and improvising music by playing a chess game. A game server
    stores a representation of the state of a game, validates proposed moves by players,
    updates game state, and extracts a graph of piece-to-piece relationships. It also
    loads a plugin code module that acts as a composition. A plugin maps pieces and
    relationships on the board, such as support or attack relationships, to a timed
    sequence of notes and accents. The server transmits notes in a sequence to an
    audio renderer process via network datagrams. Two players can perform a composition
    by playing chess, and a player can improvise by adjusting a plugin''s music mapping
    parameters via a graphical user interface. A composer can create a new composition
    by writing a new plugin that uses a distinct algorithm for mapping game rules
    and states to music. A composer can also write a new note-to-sound mapping program
    in the audio renderer language. This software is available at http://faculty.kutztown.edu/parson/music/ParsonMusic.html. '

  abstract: 'Haptic technology, providing force cues and creating a programmable physical
    instrument interface, can assist musicians in making gestures. The finite reaction
    time of thehuman motor control system implies that the execution of abrief musical
    gesture does not rely on immediate feedbackfrom the senses, rather it is preprogrammed
    to some degree.Consequently, we suggest designing relatively simple anddeterministic
    interfaces for providing haptic assistance.In this paper, we consider the specific
    problem of assisting a musician in selecting pitches from a continuous range.We
    build on a prior study by O''Modhrain of the accuracyof pitches selected by musicians
    on a Theremin-like hapticinterface. To improve the assistance, we augment the
    interface with programmed detents so that the musician can feelthe locations of
    equal tempered pitches. Nevertheless, themusician can still perform arbitrary
    pitch inflections such asglissandi, falls, and scoops. We investigate various
    formsof haptic detents, including fixed detent levels and forcesensitive detent
    levels. Preliminary results from a subjecttest confirm improved accuracy in pitch

  abstract: 'The carillon is one of the few instruments that elicit sophisticated
    haptic interaction from amateur and professional players alike. Like the piano
    keyboard, the velocity of a player''s impact on each carillon key, or baton, affects
    the quality of the resultant tone; unlike the piano, each carillon baton returns
    a different forcefeedback. Force-feedback varies widely from one baton to the
    next across the entire range of the instrument and with further idiosyncratic
    variation from one instrument to another. This makes the carillon an ideal candidate
    for haptic simulation. The application of synthesized forcefeedback based on an
    analysis of forces operating in a typical carillon mechanism offers a blueprint
    for the design of an electronic practice clavier and with it the solution to a
    problem that has vexed carillonists for centuries, namely the inability to rehearse
    repertoire in private. This paper will focus on design and implementation of a
    haptic carillon clavier derived from an analysis of the Australian National Carillon

  abstract: '“The reinvigoration of the role of the human body” - as John Richards
    recently described trends in using homemade electronics to move away from laptop

    closely with the electronic sounds they are helping to create. For these players,
    there has often been a one-way street of the ‘instrument feeds MAX patch’ paradigm
    and arguments are made here for more complete performance feedback systems. Instrumentalists
    come to the question of interactivity with a whole array of gestures, sounds and
    associations already in place, so must choose carefully the means by which the
    instrumental performance is augmented. Frances-Marie Uitti [2] is a pioneer in
    the field, creating techniques to amplify the cellist’s innate performative gestures
    and in parallel developing the instrument. This paper intends to give an overview

    System evaluation showed the SVM to reliably differentiate between eight different
    classes. An initial formative user evaluation with ten musicians was carried out
    to help build a picture of how users responded to the system; this highlighted
    areas that need improvement and lent some insight into useful features for the

  abstract: 'When we asked a colleague of ours why people do not make more haptic
    musical instruments, he replied that he thought they were “too hard to program
    and too expensive.” We decided to solve these perceived problems by introducing
    HSP, a simple platform for implementing haptic musical instruments. HSP obviates
    the need for employing low-level embedded control software because the haptic
    device is controlled directly from within the Pure Data (Pd) software running
    on a general purpose computer. Positions can be read from the haptic device, and
    forces can be written to the device using messages in Pd. Various additional objects
    have been created to facilitate rapid prototyping of useful haptic musical instruments
    in Pd. HSP operates under Linux, OS X, and Windows and supports the mass-produced
    Falcon haptic device from NovInt, which can currently be obtained for as little
    as US\$150. All of the above make HSP an especially excellent choice for pedagogical
    environments where multiple workstations are required and example programs should

  abstract: 'This paper reports on a workshop where participants produced physical
    mock-ups of musical interfaces directly after miming control of short electroacoustic
    music pieces. Our goal was understanding how people envision and materialize their
    own sound-producing gestures from spontaneous cognitive mappings. During the workshop,
    50 participants from different creative backgrounds modeled more than 180 physical
    artifacts. Participants were filmed and interviewed for the later analysis of
    their different multimodal associations about music. Our initial hypothesis was
    that most of the physical mock-ups would be similar to the sound-producing objects
    that participants would identify in the musical pieces. Although the majority
    of artifacts clearly showed correlated design trajectories, our results indicate
    that a relevant number of participants intuitively decided to engineer alternative
    solutions emphasizing their personal design preferences. Therefore, in this paper
    we present and discuss the workshop format, its results and the possible applications
    for designing new musical interfaces.'

    of the piano by the performer and accompanied by an automatic harp. The automatic
    harp can play music based on the electronic score and change its speed according
    to the speed of the performer. We built a 32-channel automatic harp and designed
    a layered modular framework integrating both hardware and software, for experimental
    real-time control protocols. Considering that MIDI keyboard lacking information
    of force (acceleration) and fingering detection, both of which are important for

    They are used to accurately detect speed, force (corresponding to velocity in

  abstract: 'The Symbaline is an active instrument comprised of several partly-filled
    wine glasses excited by electromagnetic coils. This work describes an electromechanical
    system for incorporating frequency and amplitude modulation to the Symbaline''s
    sound. A pendulum having a magnetic bob is suspended inside the liquid in the
    wine glass. The pendulum is put into oscillation by driving infra-sound signals
    through the coil. The pendulum''s movement causes the liquid in the glass to slosh
    back and forth. Simultaneously, wine glass sounds are produced by driving audio-range
    signals through the coil, inducing vibrations in a small magnet attached to the
    glass surface and exciting glass vibrations. As the glass vibrates, the sloshing
    liquid periodically changes the glass''s resonance frequencies and dampens the
    glass, thus modulating both wine glass pitch and sound intensity.'

    \ of a resonance box made of cardboard containing customised push buttons that\
    \ interact with a smartphone through its video camera. Each button can be mapped\
    \ to a set of MIDI notes or control parameters. The sound is generated through\
    \ synthesis or sample playback and can be amplified with the help of a transducer,\
    \ which excites the resonance box. An essential contribution of this interface\
    \ is the possibility of reconfiguration of the buttons layout without the need\
    \ to hard rewire the system since it uses only the smartphone built-in camera.\
    \ This features allow for quick instrument customisation for different use cases,\n\
    such as low cost projects for schools or instrument building  workshops. Our case\

    that BLE MIDI has comparable performance with the tested WiFi implementations,
    with end-to-end (sensor input to audio output) latencies of under 10ms under certain

  abstract: 'Although several Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) have been presented
    at NIME, very few of them remain accessible to the community. Rebuilding a DMI
    is often a necessary step to allow for performance with NIMEs. Rebuilding a DMI
    exactly similar to its original, however, might not be possible due to technology
    obsolescence, lack of documentation or other reasons. It might then be interesting
    to re-interpret a DMI and build an instrument inspired by the original one, creating
    novel performance opportunities. This paper presents the challenges and approaches
    involved in rebuilding and re-interpreting an existing DMI, The Sponge by Martin
    Marier. The rebuilt versions make use of newer/improved technology and customized
    design aspects like addition of vibrotactile feedback and implementation of different
    mapping strategies. It also discusses the implications of embedding sound synthesis
    within the DMI, by using the Prynth framework and further presents a comparison
    between this approach and the more traditional ground-up approach. As a result
    of the evaluation and comparison of the two rebuilt DMIs, we present a third version
    which combines the benefits and discuss performance issues with these devices.'

  abstract: 'Libration Perturbed is a performance and an improvisation instrument,
    originally composed and designed for a multi-speaker dome. The performer controls
    a bank of 64 virtual inter-connected resonating strings, with individual and direct
    control of tuning and resonance characteristics through a multitouch-enhanced
    klavier interface (TouchKeys). It is a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument,
    as all string vibrations originate from physical vibrations in the klavier and
    its casing, captured through contact microphones. In addition, there are gestural
    strings, called ropes, excited by performed musical gestures. All strings and
    ropes are connected, and inter-resonate together as a ”super-harp”, internally
    and through the performance space. With strong resonance, strings may go into
    chaotic motion or emergent quasi-periodic patterns, but custom adaptive leveling
    mechanisms keep loudness under the musician''s control at all times. The hybrid
    digital/acoustic approach and the enhanced keyboard provide for an expressive
    and very physical interaction, and a strong multi-channel immersive experience.
    The paper describes the aesthetic choices behind the design of the system, as
    well as the technical implementation, and – primarily – the interaction design,
    as it emerges from mapping, sound design, physical modeling and integration of
    the acoustic, the gestural, and the virtual. The work is evaluated based on the
    experiences from a series of performances.'

  abstract: 'This research represents an evolution and evaluation of the embodied
    physical laptop instruments. Specifically, these are instruments that are physical
    in that they use bodily interaction, take advantage of the physical affordances
    of the laptop. They are embodied in the sense that instruments are played in such
    ways where the sound is embedded to be close to the instrument. Three distinct
    laptop instruments, Taptop, Armtop, and Blowtop, are introduced in this paper.
    We discuss the integrity of the design process with composing for laptop instruments
    and performing with them. In this process, our aim is to blur the boundaries of
    the composer and designer/engineer roles. How the physicality is achieved by leveraging
    musical gestures gained through traditional instrument practice is studied, as
    well as those inspired by body gestures. We aim to explore how using such interaction
    methods affects the communication between the ensemble and the audience. An aesthetic-first
    qualitative evaluation of these interfaces is discussed, through works and performances
    crafted specifically for these instruments and presented in the concert setting
    of the laptop orchestra. In so doing, we reflect on how such physical, embodied
    instrument design practices can inform a different kind of expressive and performance
    mindset.'

  abstract: 'This work aims to explore the use of a new gesture-based interaction

    In the proposed approach, a composer (called Soundpainter) performs Soundpainting
    gestures facing a Kinect sensor. Then, a gesture recognition system captures gestures
    that are sent to a sound generator software. The proposed method was used to stage
    an artistic show in which a Soundpainter had to improvise with 6 different gestures
    to generate a musical composition from different sounds in real time. The accuracy
    of the gesture recognition system was evaluated as well as Soundpainter''s user
    experience. In addition, a user evaluation study for using our proposed system

    that uses electromagnetic induction to sense the motion of the pick with respect

    with nuanced control of the sound which coexists with traditional plucking-hand
    technique. The paper presents three ways that the signal from the pick can modulate
    the guitar sound, followed by a case study of its use in which 11 guitarists tested
    the Magpick for five days and composed a piece with it. Reflecting on their comments
    and experiences, we outline the innovative features of this technology from the

    the high temporal resolution, low latency, and large dynamic range of the Magpick
    support a highly nuanced control over the sound. Our discussion highlights the

  abstract: 'Skini is a platform for composing and producing live performances with
    audience participating using connected devices (smartphones, tablets, PC, etc.).
    The music composer creates beforehand musical elements such as melodic patterns,
    sound patterns, instruments, group of instruments, and a dynamic score that governs
    the way the basic elements will behave according to events produced by the audience.
    During the concert or the performance, the audience, by interacting with the system,
    gives birth to an original music composition. Skini music scores are expressed
    in terms of constraints that establish relationships between instruments. A constraint
    maybe instantaneous, for instance one may disable violins while trumpets are playing.
    A constraint may also be temporal, for instance, the piano cannot play more than
    30 consecutive seconds. The Skini platform is implemented in Hop.js and HipHop.js.
    HipHop.js, a synchronous reactive DLS, is used for implementing the music scores
    as its elementary constructs consisting of high level operators such as parallel
    executions, sequences, awaits, synchronization points, etc, form an ideal core
    language for implementing Skini constraints. This paper presents the Skini platform.
    It reports about live performances and an educational project. It briefly overviews
    the use of HipHop.js for representing score.'

  abstract: 'Due to video game controls great presence in popular culture and its
    ease of access, even people who are not in the habit of playing electronic games
    possibly interacted with this kind of interface once in a lifetime. Thus, gestures
    like pressing a sequence of buttons, pressing them simultaneously or sliding your
    fingers through the control can be mapped for musical creation. This work aims
    the elaboration of a strategy in which several gestures performed in a joystick
    control can influence one or several parameters of the sound synthesis, making
    a mapping denominated many to many. Buttons combinations used to perform game
    actions that are common in fighting games, like Street Fighter, were mapped to
    the synthesizer to create a music. Experiments show that this mapping is capable
    of influencing the musical expression of a DMI making it closer to an acoustic

  abstract: 'This paper discusses the creation of instruments in which music is intentionally
    generated by dance. We introduce the conceptual framework of Digital Dance and
    Music Instruments (DDMI). Several DDMI have already been created, but they have
    been developed isolatedly, and there is still a lack of a common process of ideation
    and development. Knowledge about Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) and Interactive
    Dance Systems (IDSs) can contribute to the design of DDMI, but the former brings
    few contributions to the body''s expressiveness, and the latter brings few references
    to an instrumental relationship with music. Because of those different premises,
    the integration between both paradigms can be an arduous task for the designer
    of DDMI. The conceptual framework of DDMI can also serve as a bridge between DMIs
    and IDSs, serving as a lingua franca between both communities and facilitating
    the exchange of knowledge. The conceptual framework has shown to be a promising
    analytical tool for the design, development, and evaluation of new digital dance

  abstract: 'Visitors interact with a blindfolded artist''s body, the motions of which
    are tracked and translated into synthesized four-channel sound, surrounding the

    design, and the investigations of bodily interaction with normal lay-people and
    with professional contact-improvisation dancers. The extra layer of social-physical
    interaction both constrains and inspires the participant-artist relation and the
    sonic exploration, and through this, his body is transformed into an instrument,
    and physical space is transformed into a sound-space. The project aims to explore

    departing from a set of existing theories on embodiment. In the paper, its underlying

  abstract: 'Haptic interfaces have untapped the sense of touch to assist multimodal
    music learning. We have recently seen various improvements of interface design
    on tactile feedback and force guidance aiming to make instrument learning more
    effective. However, most interfaces are still quite static; they cannot yet sense
    the learning progress and adjust the tutoring strategy accordingly. To solve this
    problem, we contribute an adaptive haptic interface based on the latest design
    of haptic flute. We first adopted a clutch mechanism to enable the interface to
    turn on and off the haptic control flexibly in real time. The interactive tutor
    is then able to follow human performances and apply the “teacher force” only when
    the software instructs so. Finally, we incorporated the adaptive interface with
    a step-by-step dynamic learning strategy. Experimental results showed that dynamic
    learning dramatically outperforms static learning, which boosts the learning rate
    by 45.3% and shrinks the forgetting chance by 86%.'

  abstract: 'The Rulers is a Digital Musical Instrument with 7 metal beams, each of
    which is fixed at one end. It uses infrared sensors, Hall sensors, and strain
    gauges to estimate deflection. These sensors each perform better or worse depending
    on the class of gesture the user is making, motivating sensor fusion practices.
    Residuals between Kalman filters and sensor output are calculated and used as
    input to a recurrent neural network which outputs a classification that determines
    which processing parameters and sensor measurements are employed. Multiple instances
    (30) of layer recurrent neural networks with a single hidden layer varying in
    size from 1 to 10 processing units were trained, and tested on previously unseen
    data. The best performing neural network has only 3 hidden units and has a sufficiently
    low error rate to be good candidate for gesture classification. This paper demonstrates
    that: dynamic networks out-perform feedforward networks for this type of gesture
    classification, a small network can handle a problem of this level of complexity,
    recurrent networks of this size are fast enough for real-time applications of
    this type, and the importance of training multiple instances of each network architecture
    and selecting the best performing one from within that set.'

  abstract: 'We present a work where a space of realtime synthesized sounds is explored
    through ear (Oto) and movement (Kinesis) by one or two dancers. Movement is tracked
    and mapped through extensive pre-processing to a high-dimensional acoustic space,
    using a many-to-many mapping, so that every small body movement matters. Designed
    for improvised exploration, it works as both performance and installation. Through
    this re-translation of bodily action, position, and posture into infinite-dimensional
    sound texture and timbre, the performers are invited to re-think and re-learn
    position and posture as sound, effort as gesture, and timbre as a bodily construction.
    The sound space can be shared by two people, with added modes of presence, proximity
    and interaction. The aesthetic background and technical implementation of the
    system are described, and the system is evaluated based on a number of performances,
    workshops and installation exhibits. Finally, the aesthetic and choreographic
    motivations behind the performance narrative are explained, and discussed in the
    light of the design of the sonification.'

  abstract: 'Taking inspiration from research into deliberately constrained musical
    technologies and the emergence of neurodiverse, child-led musical groups such
    as the Artism Ensemble, the interplay between design-constraints, inclusivity
    and appro- priation is explored. A small scale review covers systems from two
    prominent UK-based companies, and two itera- tions of a new prototype system that
    were developed in collaboration with a small group of young people on the autistic
    spectrum. Amongst these technologies, the aspects of musical experience that are
    made accessible differ with re- spect to the extent and nature of each system''s
    constraints. It is argued that the design-constraints of the new prototype system
    facilitated the diverse playing styles and techniques observed during its development.
    Based on these obser- vations, we propose that deliberately constrained musical
    instruments may be one way of providing more opportuni- ties for the emergence
    of personal practices and preferences in neurodiverse groups of children and young
    people, and that this is a fitting subject for further research.'

  abstract: 'We introduce a machine learning technique to autonomously generate novel
    melodies that are variations of an arbitrary base melody. These are produced by
    a neural network that ensures that (with high probability) the melodic and rhythmic
    structure of the new melody is consistent with a given set of sample songs. We
    train a Variational Autoencoder network to identify a low-dimensional set of variables
    that allows for the compression and representation of sample songs. By perturbing
    these variables with Perlin Noise---a temporally-consistent parameterized noise
    function---it is possible to generate smoothly-changing novel melodies. We show
    that (1) by regulating the amount of noise, one can specify how much of the base
    song will be preserved; and (2) there is a direct correlation between the noise
    signal and the differences between the statistical properties of novel melodies
    and the original one. Users can interpret the controllable noise as a type of
    "creativity knob": the higher it is, the more leeway the network has to generate
    significantly different melodies. We present a physical prototype that allows
    musicians to use a keyboard to provide base melodies and to adjust the network''s
    "creativity knobs" to regulate in real-time the process that proposes new melody
    ideas.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents a system that allows users to quickly try different
    ways to train neural networks and temporal modeling techniques to associate arm
    gestures with time varying sound. We created a software framework for this, and
    designed three interactive sounds and presented them to participants in a workshop
    based study. We build upon previous work in sound-tracing and mapping-by-demonstration
    to ask the participants to design gestures with which to perform the given sounds
    using a multimodal, inertial measurement (IMU) and muscle sensing (EMG) device.
    We presented the user with four techniques for associating sensor input to synthesizer
    parameter output. Two were classical techniques from the literature, and two proposed
    different ways to capture dynamic gesture in a neural network. These four techniques
    were: 1.) A Static Position regression training procedure, 2.) A Hidden Markov
    based temporal modeler, 3.) Whole Gesture capture to a neural network, and 4.)
    a Windowed method using the position-based procedure on the fly during the performance
    of a dynamic gesture. Our results show trade-offs between accurate, predictable
    reproduction of the source sounds and exploration of the gesture-sound space.
    Several of the users were attracted to our new windowed method for capturing gesture
    anchor points on the fly as training data for neural network based regression.
    This paper will be of interest to musicians interested in going from sound design
    to gesture design and offers a workflow for quickly trying different mapping-by-demonstration
    techniques.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes the process of developing a shared instrument for

    between standstill vs motion, and silence vs sound. The piece Vrengt grew from
    the idea of enabling a true partnership between a musician and a dancer, developing
    an instrument that would allow for active co-performance. Using a participatory
    design approach, we worked with sonification as a tool for systematically exploring
    the dancer''s bodily expressions. The exploration used a "spatiotemporal matrix",
    with a particular focus on sonic microinteraction. In the final performance, two
    Myo armbands were used for capturing muscle activity of the arm and leg of the
    dancer, together with a wireless headset microphone capturing the sound of breathing.
    In the paper we reflect on multi-user instrument paradigms, discuss our approach
    to creating a shared instrument using sonification as a tool for the sound design,
    and reflect on the performers'' subjective evaluation of the instrument.   '

  abstract: 'With a new digital music instrument (DMI), the interface itself, the
    sound generation, the composition, and the performance are often closely related
    and even intrinsically linked with each other. Similarly, the instrument designer,
    composer, and performer are often the same person. The Academic Festival Overture
    is a new piece of music for the DMI Trombosonic and symphonic orchestra written
    by a composer who had no prior experience with the instrument. The piece underwent
    the phases of a composition competition, rehearsals, a music video production,
    and a public live performance. This whole process was evaluated reflecting on
    the experience of three involved key stakeholder: the composer, the conductor,
    and the instrument designer as performer. `Blending dimensions'' of these stakeholder
    and decoupling the composition from the instrument designer inspired the newly
    involved composer to completely rethink the DMI''s interaction and sound concept.
    Thus, to deliberately avoid an early collaboration between a DMI designer and
    a composer bears the potential for new inspiration and at the same time the challenge
    to seek such a collaboration in the need of clarifying possible misunderstandings
    and improvement.'

    loop. The proposed system is based on a natural language processing technique:
    word-based sequence-to-sequence learning using LSTM units. The novelty of the
    proposed method lies in the fact that the system is not reliant on a voice-by-voice
    transcription of drums; instead, in this method, a drum representation is used
    as an input sequence from which a translated bassline is obtained at the output.
    The drum representation consists of fixed size sequences of onsets detected from
    a 2-bar audio drum loop in eight different frequency bands. The basslines generated
    by this method consist of pitched notes with different duration. The proposed
    system was trained on two distinct datasets compiled for this project by the authors.
    Each dataset contains a variety of 2-bar drum loops with annotated basslines from
    two different styles of dance music: House and Soca. A listening experiment designed
    based on the system revealed that the proposed system is capable of generating
    basslines that are interesting and are well rhythmically interlocked with the

  abstract: 'This paper is about creating digital musical instruments where a predictive
    neural network model is integrated into the interactive system. Rather than predicting
    symbolic music (e.g., MIDI notes), we suggest that predicting future control data
    from the user and precise temporal information can lead to new and interesting
    interactive possibilities. We propose that a mixture density recurrent neural
    network (MDRNN) is an appropriate model for this task. The predictions can be
    used to fill-in control data when the user stops performing, or as a kind of filter
    on the user''s own input. We present an interactive MDRNN prediction server that
    allows rapid prototyping of new NIMEs featuring predictive musical interaction
    by recording datasets, training MDRNN models, and experimenting with interaction
    modes. We illustrate our system with several example NIMEs applying this idea.
    Our evaluation shows that real-time predictive interaction is viable even on single-board

  abstract: 'When designing an augmented acoustic instrument, it is often of interest
    to retain an instrument''s sound quality and nuanced response while leveraging
    the richness of digital synthesis.  Digital audio has traditionally been generated
    through speakers, separating sound generation from the instrument itself, or by
    adding an actuator within the instrument''s resonating body, imparting new sounds
    along with the original.  We offer a third option, isolating the playing interface
    from the actuated resonating body, allowing us to rewrite the relationship between
    performance action and sound result while retaining the general form and feel
    of the acoustic instrument.  We present a hybrid acoustic-electronic violin based
    on a stick-body electric violin and an electrodynamic polyphonic pick-up capturing
    individual string displacements.  A conventional violin body acts as the resonator,
    actuated using digitally altered audio of the string inputs.  By attaching the
    electric violin above the body with acoustic isolation, we retain the physical
    playing experience of a normal violin along with some of the acoustic filtering
    and radiation of a traditional build.  We propose the use of the hybrid instrument
    with digitally automated pitch and tone correction to make an easy violin for
    use as a potential motivational tool for beginning violinists.'

  abstract: 'During the musical performance, expert musicians consciously manipulate
    acoustical parameters expressing their interpretative choices. Also, players make
    physical motions and, in many cases, these gestures are related to the musicians''
    artistic intentions. However, it''s not clear if the sound manipulation reflects
    in physical motions. The understanding of the musical structure of the work being
    performed in its many levels may impact the projection of artistic intentions,
    and performers alter it in micro and macro-sections, such as in musical motifs,
    phrases and sessions. Therefore, this paper investigates the timing manipulation
    and how such variations may reflect in physical gestures. The study involved musicians
    (flute, clarinet, and bassoon players) performing a unison excerpt by G. Rossini.
    We analyzed the relationship between timing variation (the Inter Onsets Interval
    deviations) and physical motion based on the traveled distance of the flute under
    different conditions. The flutists were asked to play the musical excerpt in three
    experimental conditions: (1) playing solo and playing in duets with previous recordings
    by other instrumentalists, (2) clarinetist and (3) bassoonist. The finding suggests
    that: 1) the movements, which seem to be related to the sense of pulse, are recurrent
    and stable, 2) the timing variability in micro or macro sections reflects in gestures''
    amplitude performed by flutists.'

    The actual action-sounds are captured with a piezoelectric transducer and processed
    in Max 8 to extend the sonic range existing in the acoustical domain alone. The
    control parameters are captured by the Morph and mapped to audio algorithm proprieties
    like filter cutoff frequency, frequency shift or overdrive. The instrument opens
    up the possibility for a large selection of different interaction techniques that
    have a direct impact on the output sound. The instrument is evaluated from a sound
    designer''s perspective, encouraging exploration in the materials used as well
    as techniques. The contribution are two-fold. First, the use of a piezo transducer
    to augment the Sensel Morph affords an extra dimension of control on top of the
    offerings. Second, the use of acoustic sounds from physical interactions as a

  abstract: 'Generating convincing music via deep neural networks is a challenging
    problem that shows promise for many applications including interactive musical
    creation. One part of this challenge is the problem of generating convincing accompaniment
    parts to a given melody, as could be used in an automatic accompaniment system.
    Despite much progress in this area, systems that can automatically learn to generate
    interesting sounding, as well as harmonically plausible, accompanying melodies
    remain somewhat elusive. In this paper we explore the problem of sequence to sequence
    music generation where a human user provides a sequence of notes, and a neural
    network model responds with a harmonically suitable sequence of equal length.
    We consider two sequence-to-sequence models; one featuring standard unidirectional
    long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, and the other featuring bidirectional
    LSTM, both successfully trained to produce a sequence based on the given input.
    Both of these are fairly dated models, as part of the investigation is to see
    what can be achieved with such models. These are evaluated and compared via a
    qualitative study that features 106 respondents listening to eight random samples
    from our set of generated music, as well as two human samples. From the results
    we see a preference for the sequences generated by the bidirectional model as
    well as an indication that these sequences sound more human.'

  abstract: 'Bendit\_I/O is a system that allows for wireless, networked performance
    of circuit-bent devices, giving artists a new outlet for performing with repurposed
    technology. In a typical setup, a user pre-bends a device using the Bendit\_I/O
    board as an intermediary, replacing physical switches and potentiometers with
    the board''s reed relays, motor driver, and digital potentiometer signals. Bendit\_I/O
    brings the networking techniques of distributed music performances to the hardware
    hacking realm, opening the door for creative implementation of multiple circuit-bent
    devices in audiovisual experiences. Consisting of a Wi-Fi- enabled I/O board and
    a Node-based server, the system provides performers with a variety of interaction
    and control possibilities between connected users and hacked devices. Moreover,
    it is user-friendly, low-cost, and modular, making it a flexible toolset for artists
    of diverse experience levels.'

  abstract: '''Where Is The Quiet?'' is a mixed-media installation that utilizes immersive
    experience design, mechatronics, and machine learning in order to enhance wellness
    and increase connectivity to the natural world. Individuals interact with the
    installation by wearing a brainwave interface that measures the strength of the
    alpha wave signal. The interface then transmits the data to a computer that uses
    it in order to determine the individual''s overall state of relaxation. As the
    individual achieves higher states of relaxation, mechatronic instruments respond
    and provide feedback. This feedback not only encourages self-awareness but also
    it motivates the individual to relax further. Visitors without the headset experience
    the installation by watching a film and listening to an original musical score.
    Through the novel arrangement of technologies and features, ''Where Is The Quiet?''
    demonstrates that mediated technological experiences are capable of evoking meditative
    states of consciousness, facilitating individual and group connectivity, and deepening
    awareness of the natural world. As such, this installation opens the door to future
    research regarding the possibility of immersive experiences supporting humanitarian
    needs.'

  abstract: 'This article questions the notion of ephemerality of digital musical
    instruments (DMI). Longevity is generally regarded as a valuable quality that
    good design criteria should help to achieve. However, the nature of the tools,
    of the performance conditions and of the music itself may lead to think of ephemerality
    as an intrinsic modality of the existence of DMIs. In particular, the conditions
    of contemporary musical production suggest that contextual adaptations of instrumental
    devices beyond the monolithic unity of classical instruments should be considered.
    The first two parts of this article analyse various reasons to reassess the issue
    of longevity and ephemerality. The last two sections attempt to propose an articulation
    of these two aspects to inform both the design of the DMI and their learning.'

  abstract: 'Mechatronic chordophones have become increasingly common in mechatronic
    music. As expressive instruments, they offer multiple techniques to create and

    multiple forms, from frames that play a guitar-like instrument, to machines that
    integrate strings and actuators as part of their frame. However, few of these
    instruments have taken advantage of dynamics, which have been largely unexplored.
    This paper details the design and construction of a new picking mechanism prototype
    which enables expressive techniques through fast and precise movement and actuation.
    We have adopted iterative design and rapid prototyping strategies to develop and
    refine a compact picker capable of creating dynamic variations reliably. Finally,
    a quantitative evaluation process demonstrates that this system offers the speed
    and consistency of previously existing picking mechanisms, while providing increased

    composition, which are areas of great interest in the present-day field of music
    technology. This paper aims to analyze the technological innovation, aesthetic
    design process, and impact of Harriet Padberg''s original 1964 thesis as well
    as the design of a modern recreation and utilization, in order to gain insight
    to the nature of revisiting older works. Here, we present our open source recreation
    of Padberg''s program with a modern interface and, through its use as an artistic
    tool by three composers, show how historical works can be effectively used for
    new creative purposes in contemporary contexts. Not Even One by Molly Jones draws
    on the historical and social significance of Harriet Padberg through using her
    program in a piece about the lack of representation of women judges in composition
    competitions. Brevity by Anna Savery utilizes the original software design as
    a composition tool, and The Padberg Piano by Anthony Caulkins uses the melodic
    generation of the original to create a software instrument.'

  abstract: 'Feature-based synthesis applies machine learning and signal processing
    methods to the development of alternative interfaces for controlling parametric
    synthesis algorithms. One approach, geared toward real-time control, uses low
    dimensional gestural controllers and learned mappings from control spaces to parameter
    spaces, making use of an intermediate latent timbre distribution, such that the
    control space affords a spatially-intuitive arrangement of sonic possibilities.
    Whereas many existing systems present alternatives to the traditional parametric
    interfaces, the proposed system explores ways in which feature-based synthesis
    can augment one-to-one parameter control, made possible by fully invertible mappings
    between control and parameter spaces.'

  abstract: 'Modern computer music performances often involve a musical instrument
    that is primarily digital; software runs on a computer, and the physical form
    of the instrument is the computer. In such a practice, the performance interface
    is rendered on a computer screen for the performer. There has been a concern in
    using a laptop as a musical instrument from the audience''s perspective, in that
    having ``a laptop performer sitting behind the screen'''' makes it difficult for
    the audience to understand how the performer is creating music.  Mirroring a computer
    screen on a projection screen has been one way to address the concern and reveal
    the performer''s instrument. This paper introduces and discusses the author''s
    computer music practice, in which a performer actively considers screen mirroring
    as an essential part of the performance, beyond visualization of music. In this
    case, screen mirroring is not complementary, but inevitable from the inception
    of the performance. The related works listed within explore various roles of screen
    mirroring in computer music performance and helps us understand empirical and
    logistical findings in such practices.'

  abstract: 'Improvising to non-modal chord progressions such as those found in jazz
    necessitates switching between the different scales implied by each chord. This
    work attempted to simplify improvisation by delegating the process of switching
    scales to a computer. An open-source software MIDI remapper called ChordEase was
    developed that dynamically alters the pitch of notes, in order to fit them to
    the chord scales of a predetermined song. ChordEase modifies the behavior of ordinary
    MIDI instruments, giving them new interfaces that permit non-modal music to be
    approached as if it were modal. Multiple instruments can be remapped simultaneously,
    using a variety of mapping functions, each optimized for a particular musical
    role. Harmonization and orchestration can also be automated. By facilitating the
    selection of scale tones, ChordEase enables performers to focus on other aspects
    of improvisation, and thus creates new possibilities for musical expression.'

    Our system searches for a portion of the registered lyrics whose vowel sequence
    matches the current user input using the probabilistic model, and sends the matched
    lyrics to the singing voice synthesizer. The vowel input keys are mapped onto
    a standard musical keyboard, enabling experienced keyboard players to learn the

    tasks such as driving. While auditory or haptic biofeedback may be used in these
    cases, the additional sensory channels can increase workload or act as a nuisance
    to the user. A number of studies, however, have shown that music can improve mood
    and concentration, while also reduce aggression and boredom. Here, we propose
    an intervention that combines the benefits of biofeedback and music to help users
    regulate their stress response while performing a visual task (driving a car simulator).
    Our approach encourages slow breathing by adjusting the quality of the music in
    response to the user''s breathing rate. We evaluate the intervention on a 2$\times$2
    design with music and auditory biofeedback as independent variables. Our results
    indicate that our music-biofeedback intervention leads to lower arousal (reduced
    electrodermal activity and increased heart rate variability) than music alone,
    auditory biofeedback alone and a control condition. '

  abstract: 'On a traditional keyboard, the actions required to play a consonant chord
    progression must be quite precise; accidentally strike a neighboring key, and
    a pleasant sonority is likely to become a jarring one. Inspired by the Tonnetz
    (a tonal diagram), we present a new layout of pitches defined using low-level
    harmonic notions. We demonstrate the potential of our system by mapping the random
    movements of fish in an aquarium to this layout. Qualitatively, we find that this
    captures the intuition behind mapping motion to sound. Similarly moving fish produce
    consonant chords, while fish moving in non-unison produce dissonant chords. We
    introduce an open source MATLAB library implementing these techniques, which can
    be used for sonifying multimodal streaming data. '

  abstract: 'Many new melodic instruments use a touch sensitive surface with notes
    arranged in a two-dimensional grid. Most of these arrange notes in chromatic half-steps
    along the horizontal axis and in intervals of fourths along the vertical axis.
    Although many alternatives exist, this arrangement, which resembles that of a
    bass guitar, is quickly becoming the de facto standard. In this study we present
    experimental evidence that grid based instruments are significantly easier to
    play when we tune adjacent rows in Major thirds rather than fourths. We have developed
    a grid-based instrument as an iPad app that has sold 8,000 units since 2012. To
    test our proposed alternative tuning, we taught a group twenty new users to play
    basic chords on our app, using both the standard tuning and our proposed alternative.
    Our results show that the Major thirds tuning is much easier to learn, even for
    users that have previous experience playing guitar.'

  abstract: 'Much of the challenge and appeal in remixing music comes from manipulating
    samples. Typically, identifying distinct samples of a song requires expertise
    in music production software. Additionally, it is difficult to visualize similarities
    and differences between all samples of a song simultaneously and use this to select
    samples. MusicMapper is a web application that allows nonexpert users to find
    and visualize distinctive samples from a song without any manual intervention,
    and enables remixing by having users play back clusterings of such samples. This
    is accomplished by splitting audio from the Soundcloud API into appropriately-sized
    spectrograms, and applying the t-SNE algorithm to visualize these spectrograms
    in two dimensions. Next, we apply k-means to guide the user''s eye toward related
    clusters and set $k=26$ to enable playback of the clusters by pressing keys on
    an ordinary keyboard. We present the source code (https://github.com/fatsmcgee/MusicMappr)

  abstract: 'Based on a combination of novel mapping techniques and carefully designed
    sound engines, I present an augmented hybrid piano specifically designed for improvisation.
    The mapping technique, originally developed for other control interfaces but here
    adapted to the piano keyboard, is based on a dynamic vectorization of control
    parameters, allowing both wild sonic exploration and minute intimate expression.
    The original piano sound is used as the sole sound source, subjected to processing
    techniques such as virtual resonance strings, dynamic buffer shuffling, and acoustic
    and virtual feedback. Thanks to speaker and microphone placement, the acoustic
    and processed sounds interact in both directions and blend into one new instrument.
    This also allows for unorthodox playing (knocking, plucking, shouting). Processing
    parameters are controlled from the keyboard playing alone, allowing intuitive
    control of complex processing by ear, integrating expressive musical playing with
    sonic exploration. The instrument is not random, but somewhat unpredictable. This
    feeds into the improvisation, defining a particular idiomatics of the instruments.
    Hence, the instrument itself is an essential part of the musical work. Performances
    include concerts in UK, Japan, Singapore, Australia and Sweden, in solos and ensembles,
    performed by several pianists. Variations of this hybrid instrument for digital
    keyboards are also presented.'

  abstract: 'We present Reflets, a mixed-reality environment for musical performances
    that allows for freely displaying virtual content on stage, such as 3D virtual
    musical interfaces or visual augmentations of instruments and performers. It relies
    on spectators and performers revealing virtual objects by slicing through them
    with body parts or objects, and on planar slightly reflective transparent panels
    that combine the stage and audience spaces. In this paper, we describe the approach
    and implementation challenges of Reflets. We then demonstrate that it matches
    the requirements of musical performances. It allows for placing virtual content
    anywhere on large stages, even overlapping with physical elements and provides
    a consistent rendering of this content for large numbers of spectators. It also
    preserves non-verbal communication between the audience and the performers, and
    is inherently engaging for the spectators. We finally show that Reflets opens
    musical performance opportunities such as augmented interaction between musicians
    and novel techniques for 3D sound shapes manipulation.'

  abstract: 'The multi-touch music table is a novel tabletop tangible interface for
    expressive musical performance. User touches the picture projected on the table
    glass surface to perform music. User can click, drag or use various multi-touch
    gestures with fingers to perform music expressively. The picture color, luminosity,
    size, finger gesture and pressure determine the music output. The table detects
    up to 10 finger touches with their touch pressure. We use a glass, a wood stand,
    a mini projector, a web camera and a computer to construct this music table. Hence
    this table is highly customizable. The table generates music via a re-interpretation
    of the artistic components of pictures. It is a cross modal inspiration of music
    from visual art on a tangible interface. '

  abstract: 'This paper discusses the use of typed text as a real-time input for interactive
    performance systems. A brief review of the literature discusses text-based generative
    systems, links between typing and playing percussion instruments and the use of
    typing gestures in contemporary performance practice. The paper then documents
    the author''s audio-visual system that is driven by the typing of text/lyrics
    in real-time. It is argued that the system promotes the sensation of liveness
    through clear, perceptible links between the performer''s gestures, the system''s
    audio outputs and the its visual outputs. The system also provides a novel approach
    to the use of generative techniques in the composition and live performance of
    songs. Future developments would include the use of dynamic text effects linked
    to sound generation and greater interaction between human performer and the visuals. '

    The hardware is designed to be robust and quickly reproducible (parametric design
    and machine fabrication), while the software aims to be light-weight (low-CPU

    Above all, the instrument aims for the level of control intimacy and tactile expressivity

  abstract: 'Human-Computer Music Performance for popular music -- where musical structure
    is important, but where musicians often decide on the spur of the moment exactly
    what the musical form will be -- presents many challenges to make computer systems
    that are flexible and adaptable to human musicians. One particular challenge is
    that humans easily follow scores and chord charts, adapt these to new performance
    plans, and understand media locations in musical terms (beats and measures), while
    computer music systems often use rigid and even numerical representations that
    are difficult to work with. We present new formalisms and representations, and
    a corresponding implementation, where musical material in various media is synchronized,
    where musicians can quickly alter the performance order by specifying (re-)arrangements
    of the material, and where interfaces are supported in a natural way by music
    notation.'

  abstract: 'Computer music systems can interact with humans at different levels,
    including scores, phrases, notes, beats, and gestures. However, most current systems
    lack basic musicianship skills. As a consequence, the results of human-computer
    interaction are often far less musical than the interaction between human musicians.
    In this paper, we explore the possibility of learning some basic music performance
    skills from rehearsal data. In particular, we consider the piano duet scenario
    where two musicians expressively interact with each other. Our work extends previous
    automatic accompaniment systems. We have built an artificial pianist that can
    automatically improve its ability to sense and coordinate with a human pianist,
    learning from rehearsal experience. We describe different machine learning algorithms
    to learn musicianship for duet interaction, explore the properties of the learned
    models, such as dominant features, limits of validity, and minimal training size,
    and claim that a more human-like interaction is achieved.'

    and/or composer. In both cases, the design process is not focused on creating

    repertoire and playing styles --- outside European and North American traditions.
    This challenge motivated our research. In this paper, we discuss lessons learned

  abstract: 'Locative music experiences are often non-linear and as such they are
    co-created, as the final arrangement of the music heard is guided by the movements
    of the user. We note an absence of principles and guidelines regarding how composers
    should approach the structuring of such locative soundtracks. For instance, how
    does one compose for a non-linear, indeterminate experience using linear pre-composed
    placed sounds, where fixed musical time is situated into the indeterminate time
    of the user''s experience? Furthermore, how does one create a soundtrack that
    is suitable for the location, but also functions as a coherent musical structure?
    We explore these questions by analyzing an existing `placed sound'' work from
    a traditional music theory perspective and in doing so reveal some structural
    principals from `fixed'' musical forms can also support the composition of contemporary
    locative music experiences.'

    context to engage children in technology design with parallels to hands on and
    project based learning educational approaches. Looking at tools and approaches
    used in STEM education we find much in common with the tools and approaches used
    in the creation of DMIs as well as opportunities for future development, in particular
    the use of scaffolded software and hardware toolkits. Current approaches to teaching
    and designing DMIs within the community suggest fruitful ideas for engaging novices
    in authentic design activities. Hardware toolkits and programming approaches are
    considered to identify productive approaches to teach technology design through
    building DMIs.'

  abstract: 'The following paper documents the creation of a prototype of shoe-soles
    designed to detect various postures of standing musicians using non-intrusive
    pressure sensors. In order to do so, flexible algorithms were designed with the
    capacity of working even with an imprecise placement of the sensors. This makes
    it easy and accessible for all potential users. At least 4 sensors are required:
    2 for the front and 2 for the back; this prototype uses 6. The sensors are rather
    inexpensive, widening the economic availability. For each individual musician,
    the algorithms are capable of ``personalising'''' postures in order to create
    consistent evaluations; the results of which may be, but are not limited to: new
    musical interfaces, educational analysis of technique, or music controllers. In
    building a prototype for the algorithms, data was acquired by wiring the sensors
    to a data-logger. The algorithms and tests were implemented using MATLAB. After
    designing the algorithms, various tests were run in order to prove their reliability.
    These determined that indeed the algorithms work to a sufficient degree of certainty,
    allowing for a reliable classification of a musician''s posture or position.'

  abstract: 'The Internet holds a lot of potential as a music listening, collaboration,
    and performance space. It has become commonplace to stream music and video of
    musical performance over the web. However, the goal of playing rhythmically synchronized
    music over long distances has remained elusive due to the latency inherent in
    networked communication. The farther apart two artists are from one another, the
    greater the delay. Furthermore, latency times can change abruptly with no warning.
    In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to create a distributed, synchronized
    musical instrument that allows performers to play together over long distances,
    despite latency. We describe one such instrument, MalLo, which combats latency
    by predicting a musician''s action before it is completed. MalLo sends information
    about a predicted musical note over the Internet before it is played, and synthesizes
    this note at a collaborator''s location at nearly the same moment it is played
    by the performer. MalLo also protects against latency spikes by sending the prediction
    data across multiple network paths, with the intention of routing around latency. '

  abstract: 'Live music making can be understood as an enactive process, whereby musical
    experiences are created through human action. This suggests that musical worlds
    coevolve with their agents through repeated sensorimotor interactions with the
    environment (where the music is being created), and at the same time cannot be
    separated from their sociocultural contexts. This paper investigates this claim
    by exploring ways in which technology, physiology, and context are bound up within
    two different musical scenarios: live electronic musical performance; and person-centred
    arts applications of NIMEs. In this paper I outline an ethnographic and phenomenological
    enquiry into my experiences as both a performer of live electronic and electro-instrumental
    music, as well as my extensive background in working with new technologies in
    various therapeutic and person-centred artistic situations. This is in order to
    explore the sociocultural and technological contexts in which these activities
    take place. I propose that by understanding creative musical participation as
    a highly contextualised practice, we may discover that the greatest impact of
    rapidly developing technological resources is their ability to afford richly diverse,
    personalised, and embodied forms of music making. I argue that this is applicable
    over a wide range of musical communities.'

    to users'' measured cognitive workload implicitly. Our system advances the state
    of the art in this area in three ways: 1) We demonstrate that cognitive workload
    can be classified in real-time while users play the piano using functional near-infrared
    spectroscopy. 2) We build a real-time, implicit system using this brain signal
    that musically adapts to what users are playing. 3) We demonstrate that users

  abstract: ' Cloud computing potentially ushers in a new era of computer music performance
    with exceptionally large computer music instruments consisting of 10s to 100s
    of virtual machines which we propose to call a `cloud-orchestra''. Cloud computing
    allows for the rapid provisioning of resources, but to deploy such a complicated
    and interconnected network of software synthesizers in the cloud requires a lot
    of manual work, system administration knowledge, and developer/operator skills.
    This is a barrier to computer musicians whose goal is to produce and perform music,
    and not to administer 100s of computers. This work discusses the issues facing
    cloud-orchestra deployment and offers an abstract solution and a concrete implementation.
    The abstract solution is to generate cloud-orchestra deployment plans by allowing
    computer musicians to model their network of synthesizers and to describe their
    resources. A model optimizer will compute near-optimal deployment plans to synchronize,
    deploy, and orchestrate the start-up of a complex network of synthesizers deployed
    to many computers. This model driven development approach frees computer musicians
    from much of the hassle of deployment and allocation. Computer musicians can focus
    on the configuration of musical components and leave the resource allocation up
    to the modelling software to optimize.'

  abstract: 'Inclusive music activities for people with physical disabilities commonly
    emphasise facilitated processes, based both on constrained gestural capabilities,
    and on the simplicity of the available interfaces. Inclusive music processes employ
    consumer controllers, computer access tools and/or specialized digital musical
    instruments (DMIs). The first category reveals a design ethos identified by the
    authors as artefact multiplication -- many sliders, buttons, dials and menu layers;
    the latter types offer ergonomic accessibility through artefact magnification.
    We present a prototype DMI that eschews artefact multiplication in pursuit of
    enhanced real time creative independence. We reconceptualise the universal click-drag
    interaction model via a single sensor type, which affords both binary and continuous
    performance control. Accessibility is optimized via a familiar interaction model
    and through customized ergonomics, but it is the mapping strategy that emphasizes
    transparency and sophistication in the hierarchical correspondences between the
    available gesture dimensions and expressive musical cues. Through a participatory
    and progressive methodology we identify an ostensibly simple targeting gesture
    rich in dynamic and reliable features: (1) contact location; (2) contact duration;
    (3) momentary force; (4) continuous force, and; (5) dyad orientation. These features
    are mapped onto dynamic musical cues, most notably via new mappings for vibrato

  abstract: 'The implementation of digital musical instruments is often opaque to
    the performer. Even when the relationship between action and sound is readily
    understandable, the internal hardware or software operations that create that
    relationship may be inaccessible to scrutiny or modification. This paper presents
    a new approach to digital instrument design which lets the performer alter and
    subvert the instrument''s internal operation through circuit-bending techniques.
    The approach uses low-latency feedback loops between software and analog hardware
    to expose the internal working of the instrument. Compared to the standard control
    voltage approach used on analog synths, alterations to the feedback loops produce
    distinctive and less predictable changes in behaviour with original artistic applications.
    This paper discusses the technical foundations of the approach, its roots in hacking

  abstract: 'We explore how to digitally augment musical instruments by connecting
    them to their social histories. We describe the use of Internet of Things technologies
    to connect an acoustic guitar to its digital footprint -- a record of how it was
    designed, built and played. We introduce the approach of crafting interactive
    decorative inlay into the body of an instrument that can then be scanned using
    mobile devices to reveal its digital footprint. We describe the design and construction
    of an augmented acoustic guitar called Carolan alongside activities to build its
    digital footprint through documented encounters with twenty-seven players in a
    variety of settings. We reveal the design challenge of mapping the different surfaces
    of the instrument to various facets of its footprint so as to afford appropriate
    experiences to players, audiences and technicians. We articulate an agenda for
    further research on the topic of connecting instruments to their social histories,
    including capturing and performing digital footprints and creating personalized
    and legacy experiences.'

  abstract: 'There have been more interest and research towards multisensory aspects
    of sound as well as vision and movement, especially in the last two decades. An
    emerging research field related with multi-sensory research is ''motor imagery'',
    which could be defined as the mental representation of a movement without actual
    production of muscle activity necessary for its execution. Emphasizing its close
    relationship and potential future use in new digital musical instruments (DMI)
    practice and reviewing literature, this paper will introduce fundamental concepts
    about motor imagery (MI), various methods of measuring MI in different configurations
    and summarize some important findings about MI in various studies. Following,
    it will discuss how this research area is related to DMI practice and propose
    potential uses of MI in this field. '

  abstract: 'An interactive music instrument museum experience for children of 10-12
    years is presented. Equipped with tablet devices, the children are sent on a treasure
    hunt. Based on given sound samples, the participants have to identify the right
    musical instrument (harpsichord, double bass, viola) out of an instrument collection.
    As the right instrument is located, a challenge of playing an application on the
    tablet is initiated. This application is an interactive digital representation
    of the found instrument, mimicking some of its key playing techniques, using a
    simplified scrolling on screen musical notation. The musical performance of the
    participant is graded on a point scale. After completion of the challenge, the
    participants'' performances of the three instruments are played back simultaneously,
    constituting a composition. A qualitative evaluation of the application in a focus
    group interview with school children revealed that the children were more engaged
    when playing with the interactive application than when only watching a music

  abstract: 'Audio guides and (interactive) sound walks have existed for decades.
    Even smartphone games taking place in the real world are no longer a novelty.
    But due to the lack of a sufficient middleware which fulfills the requirements
    for creating this software genre, artists, game developers and institutions such
    as museums are forced to implement rather similar functionality over and over
    again. This paper describes the basic principles of Real World Audio (RWA), an
    extendable audio game engine for targeting smartphone operating systems, which
    rolls out all functionality for the generation of the above-mentioned software
    genres. It combines the ability for building location-based audio walks and -guides
    with the components necessary for game development. Using either the smartphone
    sensors or an external sensor board for head tracking and gesture recognition,
    RWA allows developers to create audio walks, audio adventures and audio role playing
    games (RPG) outside in the real world.'

    electronic hand-drum meant for music therapy sessions with severely intellectually

    research, design guidelines related to this specific user-group and context are
    formed. This leads to a concept of which the most relevant aspects are discussed,
    before describing the user studies. Finally, the plan for the redesign is discussed.
    The WamBam has unique possibilities to deal with the low motor skills and cognitive
    abilities of severely intellectually disabled users while music therapists benefit
    from the greater versatility and portability of this design compared to other
    musical instruments. A prototype was tested with twenty users. Participants proved
    to be triggered positively by the WamBam, but three limiting usability issues
    were found. These issues were used as the fundamentals for a second prototype.
    Music therapists confirm the value of the WamBam for their practice. '

  abstract: 'Liveness is a well-known problem with Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs).
    When used in performances, DMIs provide less visual information than acoustic
    instruments, preventing the audience from understanding how the musicians influence
    the music. In this paper, we look at this issue through the lens of causality.
    More specifically, we investigate the attribution of causality by an external
    observer to a performer, relying on the theory of apparent mental causation. We
    suggest that the perceived causality between a performer''s gestures and the musical
    result is central to liveness. We present a framework for assessing attributed
    causality and agency to a performer, based on a psychological theory which suggests
    three criteria for inferred causality. These criteria then provide the basis of
    an experimental study investigating the effect of visual augmentations on audience''s
    inferred causality. The results provide insights on how the visual component of
    performances with DMIs impacts the audience''s causal inferences about the performer.
    In particular we show that visual augmentations help highlight the influence of
    the musician when parts of the music are automated, and help clarify complex mappings
    between gestures and sounds. Finally we discuss the potential wider implications
    for assessing liveness in the design of new musical interfaces.'

  abstract: The haptic hand is a greatly simplified robotic hand that is designed
    to mirror the human hand and provide haptic force feedback for applications in
    music. The fingers of the haptic hand device are laid out to align with four of
    the fingers of the human hand. A key is placed on each of the fingers so that
    a human hand can perform music by interacting with the keys. The haptic hand is
    distinguished from other haptic keyboards in the sense that each finger is meant
    to stay with a particular key. The haptic hand promotes unencumbered interaction
    with the keys. The user can easily position a finger over a key and press downward
    to activate it---the user does not need to insert his or her fingers into an unwieldy
    exoskeleton or set of thimbles. An example video demonstrates some musical ideas
    afforded by this open-source software and hardware project.

  abstract: 'This paper describes a software extension to the Reactable entitled Gestroviser

    level. The system functions by sampling a performers input, processing or reshaping
    this sampled input, and then repeatedly replaying it. The degree to which the
    sampled control signal is processed during replay is adjustable in real-time by
    the manipulation of a continuous finger slider function. The reshaping algorithm
    uses stochastic methods commonly used for MIDI note generation from a provided
    dataset. The reshaped signal therefore varies in an unpredictable manner. In this
    way the Gestroviser is a device to capture, reshape and replay an instrumental

    Those tools have various functions. Nevertheless, they still miss something which
    could benefit users very much. Even worse, they are not easy to be revised. Most
    importantly, there should be more amusing and engaging interaction between a tuning
    trainer and a user which is able to exchange roles of tuner and player. In this

    can tune his pitch while optionally hearing (through earphones) the target pitch
    and other harmonic intervals in respective octaves. Moreover, in its interactive

    program follows his intonation to generate corresponding harmonic intervals. Additionally,
    user can straightforwardly edit all parameters and patches by Pure Data. Any adoption
    or revision is absolutely welcome. Finally, we will initiate another research

  abstract: 'This paper presents the ideas and mapping strategies behind a performance
    system that uses a combination of motion tracking and feature extraction tools
    to manage complex multichannel audio materials for real-time music composition.
    The use of embodied metaphors within these mappings is seen as a means of managing
    the complexity of a musical performance across multiple modalities. In particular,
    we will investigate how these mapping strategies may facilitate the creation of
    performance systems whose accessibility and richness are enhanced by common integrating
    bases. A key focus for this work is the investigation of the embodied image schema
    theories of Lakoff and Johnson alongside similarly embodied metaphorical models
    within Smalley''s influential theory of electroacoustic music (spectromorphology).
    These metaphors will be investigated for their use as grounding structural components
    and dynamics for creative practices and musical interaction design. We argue that
    pairing metaphorical models of forces with environmental forms may have particular
    significance for the design of complex mappings for digital music performance.'

  abstract: 'This paper describes the motivation and process of developing a musical
    instrument for an unborn child. Well established research shows a fetus in the
    womb can respond to and benefit from stimuli from the outside world. A musical
    instrument designed for this unique context can leverage the power of this interaction.
    Two prototypes were constructed and tested during separate pregnancies and the
    experiences are presented, and the limitation of the sensor technology identified.
    We discuss our discoveries about design considerations and challenges for such
    an instrument, and project thought-provoking questions that arise from its potential
    applications.'

    NIME discourses. Our aim is to clarify and define the term through the community
    of practice framework. We argue that through its formal use and application, the
    notion of community becomes a significant space for the examination of emergent
    musical practices that could otherwise be overlooked. This paper defines community
    of practice, as originally developed in the social sciences by Lave and Wegener,
    and applies it within the NIME context through the examination of existing communities

    of source code both to display the state of running processes and also to alter
    state using means other than traditional text editing. In contrast to previous
    research that has focused on the inclusion of additional interactive widgets inside
    or alongside text editors, our research adds a parsing stage to the runtime evaluation
    of code fragments and imparts additional interactive capabilities on the source
    code itself. After implementing various techniques in the creative coding environment
    Gibber, we evaluate our research through a survey on the various methods of visual

  abstract: 'We present the prototype of a hybrid instrument, which uses two contact
    microphones to sonify the gestures of a player on a generic surface, while a gesture
    localization algorithm controls the pitch of the sonified output depending on
    the position of the gestures. To achieve the gesture localization we use a novel
    approach combining attack parametrization and template matching across the two
    microphone channels. With this method we can correctly localize 80 $\pm$ 9 % of
    the percussive gestures. The user can assign determined pitches to specific positions
    and change the pitch palette in real time. The tactile feedback characteristic
    of every surface opens a set of new playing strategies and possibilities specific
    to any chosen object. The advantages of such a system are the affordable production,
    flexibility of concert location, object-specific musical instruments, portability,
    and easy setup.'

  abstract: 'This study compares the stage metaphor and the channel strip metaphor
    in terms of performance. Traditionally, music mixing consoles employ a channels
    strip control metaphor for adjusting parameters such as volume and panning of
    each track. An alternative control metaphor, the so-called stage metaphor lets
    the user adjust volume and panning by positioning tracks relative to a virtual
    listening position. In this study test participants are given the task to adjust
    volume and panning of one channel (in mixes consisting of three channels) in order
    to replicate a series of simple pre-rendered mixes. They do this using (1) a small
    physical mixing controller and (2) using an iPad app, which implements a simple
    stage metaphor interface. We measure how accurately they are able to replicate
    mixes in terms of volume and panning and how fast they are at doing so. Results
    reveal that performance is surprisingly similar and thus we are not able to detect
    any significant difference in performance between the two interfaces. Qualitative
    data however, suggests that the stage metaphor is largely favoured for its intuitive
    interaction --- confirming earlier studies. '

    of performance quality. Inherent subjectivity in these assessments is inevitable,
    yet the recognition of performance attributes by which humans perceive quality
    has wide applicability to related tasks in the music information retrieval (MIR)
    community and jazz pedagogy. Preliminary results indicate that several musiciologically-informed
    features of relatively low computational complexity perform reasonably well in
    predicting performance quality labels via ordinary least squares regression.'

    artistic considerations that drive the development and design of a work in unique
    ways. Thus, in the case of the Wave Duet, the produced buoys were prompted by
    investigating the relationship between sonic objects and natural phenomena. As
    a result, the mappings, physical and sound designs directly reflect these issues.
    Finally, it is also suggested that during the course of development, unintended

  abstract: 'This paper presents a new visualization paradigm for graphical interpolation
    systems, known as Star Interpolation, that has been specifically created for sound
    design applications. Through the presented investigation of previous visualizations,
    it becomes apparent that the existing visuals in this class of system, generally
    relate to the interpolation model that determines the weightings of the presets
    and not the sonic output. The Star Interpolator looks to resolve this deficiency
    by providing visual cues that relate to the parameter space. Through comparative
    exploration it has been found this visualization provides a number of benefits
    over the previous systems. It is also shown that hybrid visualization can be generated
    that combined benefits of the new visualization with the existing interpolation
    models. These can then be accessed by using an Interactive Visualization (IV)
    approach. The results from our exploration of these visualizations are encouraging

    proto-instrument, Vodhrán, based on a physical model of a plate, within a musical
    performance-driven ecosystemic environment. Performers explore the plate model
    via tactile interaction through a Sensel Morph interface, chosen to allow damping
    and localised striking consistent with playing hand percussion.  Through an iteration
    of prototypes, we have designed an embedded proto-instrument that allows a bodily
    interaction between the performer and the virtual-acoustic plate in a way that
    redirects from the perception of the Sensel as a touchpad and reframes it as a
    percussive surface. Due to the computational effort required to run such a rich
    physical model and the necessity to provide a natural interaction, the audio processing
    is implemented on a high powered single board computer. We describe the design
    challenges and report on the technological solutions we have found in the implementation
    of Vodhrán which we believe are valuable to the wider NIME community.'

  abstract: 'Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are beneficial for patients who are
    suffering from motor disabilities because it offers them a way of creative expression,
    which improves mental well-being. BCIs aim to establish a direct communication
    medium between the brain and the computer. Therefore, unlike conventional musical
    interfaces, it does not require muscular power. This paper explores the potential
    of building sound synthesisers with BCIs that are based on steady-state visually
    evoked potential (SSVEP). It investigates novel ways to enable patients with motor
    disabilities to express themselves. It presents a new concept called sonic expression,
    that is to express oneself purely by the synthesis of sound. It introduces new
    layouts and designs for BCI-based sound synthesisers and the limitations of these
    interfaces are discussed. An evaluation of different sound synthesis techniques
    is conducted to find an appropriate one for such systems. Synthesis techniques
    are evaluated and compared based on a framework governed by sonic expression.'

  abstract: 'Music has previously been shown to be beneficial in improving runners
    performance in treadmill based experiments. This paper evaluates a generative
    music system, HEARTBEATS, designed to create biosignal synchronous music in real-time
    according to an individual athlete’s heart-rate or cadence (steps per minute).
    The tempo, melody, and timbral features of the generated music are modulated according
    to biosensor input from each runner using a wearable Bluetooth sensor. We compare
    the relative performance of athletes listening to heart-rate and cadence synchronous
    music, across a randomized trial (N=57) on a trail course with 76ft of elevation.
    Participants were instructed to continue until perceived effort went beyond an
    18 using the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale. We found that cadence-synchronous
    music improved performance and decreased perceived effort in male runners, and
    improved performance but not perceived effort in female runners, in comparison
    to heart-rate synchronous music. This work has implications for the future design
    and implementation of novel portable music systems and in music-assisted coaching.'

  abstract: 'Audio content-based processing has become a pervasive methodology for
    techno-fluent musicians. System architectures typically create thumbnail audio
    descriptions, based on signal processing methods, to visualize, retrieve and transform
    musical audio efficiently. Towards enhanced usability of these descriptor-based
    frameworks for the music community, the paper advances a minimal content-based
    audio description scheme, rooted on primary musical notation attributes at the
    threefold sound object, meso and macro hierarchies. Multiple perceptually-guided
    viewpoints from rhythmic, harmonic, timbral and dynamic attributes define a discrete
    and finite alphabet with minimal formal and subjective assumptions using unsupervised
    and user-guided methods. The Factor Oracle automaton is then adopted to model
    and visualize temporal morphology. The generative musical applications enabled

  abstract: 'For a long time, magnetic tape has been commonly utilized as one of physical
    media for recording and playing music. In this research, we propose a novel interactive
    musical instrument called ParaSampling that utilizes the technology of magnetic
    sound recording, and a improvisational sound playing method based on the instrument.
    While a conventional cassette tape  player has a single tapehead, which rigidly
    placed, our instrument utilizes multiple handheld tapehead modules as an interface.
    Players can hold the interfaces and press them against the rotating magnetic tape
    at an any point to record or reproduce sounds The player can also easily erase
    and rewrite the sound recorded on the tape. With this instrument, they can achieve
    improvised and unique musical expressions through tangible and spatial interactions.
    In this paper, we describe the system design of ParaSampling, the implementation
    of the prototype system, and discuss music expressions enabled by the system.'

  abstract: 'A variety of controllers with multifarious sensors and functions have

    project was to create an interface which enables the interaction between the performers
    and the effect processor measuring their brain waves amplitudes, e.g., alpha,
    beta, theta, delta and gamma, not necessarily with the user’s awareness. We achieved
    this by using an electroencephalography (EEG) sensor for detecting performer’s
    different emotional states and, based on these, sending midi messages for digital
    processing units automation. The aim is to create a new generation of digital
    processor units that could be automatically configured in real-time given the
    emotions or thoughts of the performer or the audience. By introducing emotional
    state information in the real time control of several aspects of artistic expression,
    we highlight the impact of surprise and uniqueness in the artistic performance.'

  abstract: 'Focusing on interactive performance works borne out of dancer-musician
    collaborations, this paper investigates the relationship between the mediums of
    sound and movement through a conceptual interpretation of the biological phenomenon
    of symbiosis. Describing the close and persistent interactions between organisms
    of different species, symbioses manifest across a spectrum of relationship types,
    each identified according to the health effect experienced by the engaged organisms.
    This biological taxonomy is appropriated within a framework which identifies specific
    modes of interaction between sound and movement according to the collaborating
    practitioners’ intended outcome, and required provisions, cognition of affect,
    and system operation. Using the symbiotic framework as an analytical tool, six
    dancer-musician collaborations from the field of NIME are examined in respect
    to the employed modes of interaction within each of the four examined areas. The
    findings reveal the emergence of multiple modes in each work, as well as examples
    of mutation between different modes over the course of a performance. Furthermore,
    the symbiotic concept provides a novel understanding of the ways gesture recognition
    technologies (GRTs) have redefined the relationship dynamics between dancers and
    musicians, and suggests a more efficient and inclusive approach in communicating
    the potential and limitations presented by Human-Computer Interaction tools.'

    dance studio of a special education needs (SEN) school in North-East London, UK,
    for a period of 5 weeks, every Thursday afternoon for 30 minutes. Olly uses one
    Bare touch board in midi mode and four stretch analog sensors embedded inside
    four elastic ribbons. These ribbons top the main body of the installation which
    is made by using an inflatable gym ball wrapped in felt. Each of the ribbons plays
    a different instrument and triggers different harmonic chords. Olly allows to
    play pleasant melodies if interacting with it in solo mode and more complex harmonies
    when playing together with others. Results show great potentials for carefully
    designed musical TUI implementation aimed at scaffolding social play while affording
    self-regulation in SEN contexts. We present a brief introduction on the background

  abstract: 'With the development of web audio standards, it has quickly become technically

    performances using their mobile phones. Thus, a new audience-centric musical genre
    has emerged, which aligns with artistic manifestations where there is an explicit

    and technical perspectives. This follow-up paper contributes with reflections
    on technical and aesthetic aspects of composing within this audience-centric approach.
    We propose a set of 13 composition dimensions that deal with the role of the performer,
    the role of the audience, the location of sound and the type of feedback, among
    others. From a reflective approach, four participatory pieces developed by the
    authors are analysed using the proposed dimensions. Finally, we discuss a set
    of recommendations and challenges for the composers-developers of this new and
    promising musical genre. This paper concludes discussing the implications of this

    often consider interfaces that feature a spectrum of gestures similar to already

    make when creating an idiomatic gestural language for an entirely unfamiliar instrument.
    We designed a musical interface with a unique large-scale layout to encourage

    a study where trained musicians were invited to perform one of two versions of
    the same instrument, each physically identical but with a different tone mapping.
    The study results reveal insights into how musicians develop novel performance
    gestures when encountering a new instrument characterised by an unfamiliar shape
    and size. Our discussion highlights the impact of an instrument’s scale and layout
    on the emergence of new gestural vocabularies and on the qualities of the music

    acces- sible and practical for a wider audience of students, pro- fessional musicians
    and composers. Along with develop- ment of standardised tabla notation and instructional
    educational aides, the electronic tabla is designed to be compact, robust, easily
    tuned, and the electronic nature allows for scoring tabla through playing. Further,
    used as an interface, it allows the use of learned tabla technique to control
    other percussive sounds. We also discuss the technological approaches used to
    accurately capture the localized multi-touch rapid-fire strikes and damping that
    combine to make tabla such a captivating and virtuosic instrument.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents the KeyWI, an electronic wind instrument design based
    on the melodica that both improves upon limitations in current systems and is
    general and powerful enough to support a variety of applications. Four opportunities
    for growth are identified in current electronic wind instrument systems, which
    then are used as focuses in the development and evaluation of the instrument.
    The instrument features a breath pressure sensor with a large dynamic range, a
    keyboard that allows for polyphonic pitch selection, and a completely integrated
    construction. Sound synthesis is performed with Faust code compiled to the Bela
    Mini, which offers low-latency audio and a simple yet powerful development workflow.
    In order to be as accessible and versatile as possible, the hardware and software
    is entirely open-source, and fabrication requires only common maker tools.'

  abstract: 'Computer composed music remains a novel and challenging problem to solve.
    Despite an abundance of techniques and systems little research has explored how
    these might be useful for end-users looking to compose with generative and algorithmic
    music techniques. User interfaces for generative music systems are often inaccessible
    to non-programmers and neglect established composition workflow and design paradigms
    that are familiar to computer-based music composers. We have developed a system
    called the Interactive Generative Music Environment (IGME) that attempts to bridge
    the gap between generative music and music sequencing software, through an easy
    to use score editing interface. This paper discusses a series of user studies
    in which users explore generative music composition with IGME. A questionnaire
    evaluates the user’s perception of interacting with generative music and from
    this provide recommendations for future generative music systems and interfaces.'

  abstract: 'Many opportunities and challenges in both the control and performative
    aspects of today’s modular synthesizers exist. The user interface prevailing in
    the world of synthesizers and music controllers has always been revolving around
    knobs, faders, switches, dials, buttons, or capacitive touchpads, to name a few.
    This paper presents a novel way of interaction with a modular synthesizer by exploring
    the affordances of cord-base UIs. A special patch cable was developed us- ing
    commercially available piezo-resistive rubber cords, and was adapted to fit to
    the 3.5 mm mono audio jack, making it compatible with the Eurorack modular-synth
    standard. Moreover, a module was developed to condition this stretch- able sensor/cable,
    to allow multiple Patch-cordes to be used in a given patch simultaneously. This
    paper also presents a vocabulary of interactions, labeled through various physical
    actions, turning the patch cable into an expressive controller that complements
    traditional patching techniques.'

    “Soil choir v.1.3” that sonifies soil moisture in different depths and transforms
    this non-musical phenomenon into organized sound structures. The sonification
    of natural soil moisture processes tests the limits of our attention, patience

    of our sense adaptation. Although the musical time of the installation is set
    to almost non-human – environmental time scale (changes happen within hours, days,
    weeks or even months…) this system can be explored and even played also as an
    instrument by putting sensors to different soil areas or pouring liquid into the
    soil and waiting for changes... The crucial aspect of the work was to design the
    sonification architecture that deals with extreme slow changes of input data –
    measured values from moisture sensors. The result is the sound installation consisting
    of three objects – each with different types of soil. Every object is compact,
    independent unit consisting of three low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensors,
    1m long perspex tube filled with soil, full range loudspeaker and Bela platform

  abstract: 'During theBaroque period, improvisation was a key element of music performance
    and education. Great musicians, such as J.S. Bach, were better known as improvisers
    than composers. Today,  however,  there  is  a  lack  of  improvisation culture
    in classical music performance and education; classical musicians either are not
    trained to improvise, or cannot find other people to improvise with.  Motivated
    by this observation,  we  develop BachDuet,  a  system  that  enables real-time
    counterpoint improvisation between a human anda machine.  This system uses a recurrent
    neural network toprocess the human musician’s monophonic performance ona MIDI
    keyboard and generates the machine’s monophonic performance in real time. We  develop
    a GUI to visualize the generated music content and to facilitate this interaction.
    We  conduct  user  studies  with  13  musically  trained users  and  show  the  feasibility  of  two-party  duet  counterpoint
    improvisation and the effectiveness of BachDuet for this purpose.  We also conduct
    listening tests with 48 participants and show that they cannot tell the difference
    between duets generated by human-machine improvisation using BachDuet and those
    generated by human-human improvisation.  Objective evaluation is also conducted
    to assess the degree to which these improvisations adhere to common rules of counterpoint,

    parameter, and minute gesture details can affect the final sonic result. By contrast,
    subtle variations in articulation have a relatively limited effect on the sound
    generation when the keyboard controller uses the MIDI standard, used in the vast
    majority of digital keyboards. In this paper we present an embedded platform that
    can generate sound in response to a controller capable of sensing the continuous
    position of keys on a keyboard. This platform enables the creation of keyboard-based
    DMIs which allow for a richer set of interaction gestures than would be possible
    through a MIDI keyboard, which we demonstrate through two example instruments.
    First, in a Hammond organ emulator, the sensing device allows to recreate the
    nuances of the interaction with the original instrument in a way a velocity-based
    MIDI controller could not. Second, a nonlinear waveguide flute synthesizer is
    shown as an example of the expressive capabilities that a continuous-keyboard
    controller opens up in the creation of new keyboard-based DMIs.'

    We co-developed Excello with feedback from 21 musicians at varying levels of musical

    programmatic music creation?  Our design process encountered questions such as
    how time should be represented, whether amplitude and octave should be encoded
    as properties of individual notes or entire phrases, and how best to leverage
    standard spreadsheet features, such as formulae and copy-paste. We present the

  abstract: 'In NIME design, thorough attention has been devoted to feedback modalities,
    including auditory, visual and haptic feedback. How the performer executes the
    gestures to achieve a sound on an instrument, by contrast, appears to be less
    examined. Previous research showed that auditory imagery, or the ability to hear
    or recreate sounds in the mind even when no audible sound is present, is essential
    to the sensorimotor control involved in playing an instrument. In this paper,
    we enquire whether auditory imagery can also help to support skill transfer between
    musical instruments resulting in possible implications for new instrument design.
    To answer this question, we performed two experimental studies on pitch accuracy
    and fluency where professional violinists were asked to play a modified violin.
    Results showed altered or even possibly irrelevant auditory feedback on a modified
    violin does not appear to be a significant impediment to performance. However,
    performers need to have coherent imagery of what they want to do, and the sonic
    outcome needs to be coupled to the motor program to achieve it. This finding shows
    that the design lens should be shifted from a direct feedback model of instrumental
    playing toward a model where imagery guides the playing process. This result is
    in agreement with recent research on skilled sensorimotor control that highlights
    the value of feedforward anticipation in embodied musical performance. It is also
    of primary importance for the design of new instruments: new sounds that cannot
    easily be imagined and that are not coupled to a motor program are not likely
    to be easily performed on the instrument.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we introduce the concept of VR Open Scores: aleatoric
    score-based virtual scenarios where an aleatoric score is embedded in a virtual

    and apply them in a new context. Our proposal also explores possible parallels
    between open meaning in interaction design, and aleatoric score, conceptualized
    as Open Work by the Italian philosopher Umberto Eco. Our approach has two aims.
    The first aim is to create an environment where users can immerse themselves in
    the visual elements of a score while listening to the corresponding music. The
    second aim is to facilitate users to develop a personal relationship with both
    the system and the score. To achieve those aims, as a practical implementation
    of our proposed concept, we developed two immersive scenarios: a 360º video and
    an interactive space. We conclude presenting how our design aims were accomplished
    in the two scenarios, and describing positive and negative elements of our implementations.'

    performed a new interface for musical expression in front of an audience. Thus,

    ideologies grounded in techno-solutionism. We conclude with a number of recommendations
    for stimulating community-wide discussion on these themes in the hope that this

    sensors are physically robust, they are mechanically assembled and thus easy to
    replace if damaged. The performer can also trigger presets via four FSRs attached
    to the body of the violin. The instrument is completely wireless, giving the performer
    the freedom to move throughout the performance space. While the sensing fingerboard
    is installed in place of the traditional fingerboard, all other electronics can

  abstract: 'The expressive control of sound and music through body movements is well-studied.  For
    some people, body movement is demanding, and although they would prefer to express
    themselves freely using gestural control, they are unable to use such interfaces
    without difficulty.  In this paper, we present the P(l)aying Attention framework
    for manipulating recorded music to support these people, and to help the therapists
    that work with them. The aim is to facilitate body awareness, exploration, and
    expressivity by allowing the manipulation of a pre-recorded ‘ensemble’ through
    an interpretation of body movement, provided by a machine-learning system trained
    on physiotherapist assessments and movement data from people with chronic pain.  The
    system considers the nature of a person’s movement (e.g. protective) and offers
    an interpretation in terms of the joint-groups that are playing a major role in
    the determination at that point in the movement, and to which attention should
    perhaps be given (or the opposite at the user’s discretion).  Using music to convey
    the interpretation offers informational (through movement sonification) and creative
    (through manipulating the ensemble by movement) possibilities.  The approach offers
    the opportunity to explore movement and music at multiple timescales and under
    varying musical aesthetics.'

  abstract: 'We present a musical interface specifically designed for inclusive performance
    that offers a shared experience for both individuals who are deaf and hard of
    hearing as well as those who are not. This interface borrows gestures (with or
    without overt meaning) from American Sign Language (ASL), rendered using low-frequency
    sounds that can be felt by everyone in the performance. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing
    cannot experience the sound in the same way. Instead, they are able to physically
    experience the vibrations, nuances, contours, as well as its correspondence with
    the hand gestures. Those who are not hard of hearing can experience the sound,
    but also feel it just the same, with the knowledge that the same physical vibrations
    are shared by everyone. The employment of sign language adds another aesthetic
    dimension to the instrument --a nuanced borrowing of a functional communication
    medium for an artistic end.  '

  abstract: 'General-Purpose GPU computing is becoming an increasingly viable option
    for acceleration, including in the audio domain. Although it can improve performance,
    the intrinsic nature of a device like the GPU involves data transfers and execution
    commands which requires time to complete. Therefore, there is an understandable
    caution concerning the overhead involved with using the GPU for audio computation.
    This paper aims to clarify the limitations by presenting a performance benchmarking
    suite. The benchmarks utilize OpenCL and CUDA across various tests to highlight
    the considerations and limitations of processing audio in the GPU environment.
    The benchmarking suite has been used to gather a collection of results across
    various hardware. Salient results have been reviewed in order to highlight the
    benefits and limitations of the GPU for digital audio. The results in this work
    show that the minimal GPU overhead fits into the real-time audio requirements
    provided the buffer size is selected carefully. The baseline overhead is shown
    to be roughly 0.1ms, depending on the GPU. This means buffer sizes 8 and above
    are completed within the allocated time frame. Results from more demanding tests,
    involving physical modelling synthesis, demonstrated a balance was needed between
    meeting the sample rate and keeping within limits for latency and jitter. Buffer
    sizes from 1 to 16 failed to sustain the sample rate whilst buffer sizes 512 to
    32768 exceeded either latency or jitter limits. Buffer sizes in between these
    ranges, such as 256, satisfied the sample rate, latency and jitter requirements
    chosen for this paper.'

  abstract: 'Learning to play an instrument is intrinsically multimodal, and we have
    seen a trend of applying visual and haptic feedback in music games and computer-aided
    music tutoring systems. However, most current systems are still designed to master
    individual pieces of music; it is unclear how well the learned skills can be generalized
    to new pieces. We aim to explore this question. In this study, we contribute Interactive
    Rainbow Score, an interactive visual system to boost the learning of sight-playing,
    the general musical skill to read music and map the visual representations to
    performance motions. The key design of Interactive Rainbow Score is to associate
    pitches (and the corresponding motions) with colored notation and further strengthen
    such association via real-time interactions. Quantitative results show that the
    interactive feature on average increases the learning efficiency by 31.1%. Further
    analysis indicates that it is critical to apply the interaction in the early period
    of learning.'

  abstract: 'The comparative study presented in this paper focuses on two approaches
    for the search of sound presets using a specific geometric touch app. The first
    approach is based on independent sliders on screen and is called analytic. The
    second is based on interpolation between presets represented by polygons on screen
    and is called holistic. Participants had to listen to, memorize, and search for
    sound presets characterized by four parameters. Ten different configurations of
    sound synthesis and processing were presented to each participant, once for each
    approach. The performance scores of 28 participants (not including early testers)
    were computed using two measured values: the search duration, and the parametric
    distance between the reference and answered presets. Compared to the analytic
    sliders-based interface, the holistic interpolation-based interface demonstrated
    a significant performance improvement for 60% of sound synthesizers. The other
    40% led to equivalent results for the analytic and holistic interfaces. Using
    sliders, expert users performed nearly as well as they did with interpolation.
    Beginners and intermediate users struggled more with sliders, while the interpolation
    allowed them to get quite close to experts’ results.'

  abstract: 'The purpose of this project is to develop an interface for writing and
    performing music using sequencers in virtual reality (VR). The VR sequencer deals
    with chance-based operations to select audio clips for playback and spatial orientation-based
    rhythm and melody generation, while incorporating three-dimensional (3-D) objects
    as omnidirectional playheads. Spheres which grow from a variable minimum size
    to a variable maximum size at a variable speed, constantly looping, represent
    the passage of time in this VR sequencer. The 3-D assets which represent samples
    are actually sample containers that come in six common dice shapes. As the dice
    come into contact with a sphere, their samples are triggered to play. This behavior
    mimics digital audio workstation (DAW) playheads reading MIDI left-to-right in
    popular professional and consumer software sequencers. To incorporate height into
    VR music making, the VR sequencer is capable of generating terrain at the press
    of a button. Each terrain will gradually change, creating the possibility for
    the dice to roll on their own. Audio effects are built in to each scene and mapped
    to terrain parameters, creating another opportunity for chance operations in the
    music making process. The chance-based sample selection, spatial orientation-defined
    rhythms, and variable terrain mapped to audio effects lead to indeterminacy in
    performance and replication of a single piece of music. This project aims to give
    the gaming community access to experimental music making by means of consumer
    virtual reality hardware.'

  abstract: 'Machine learning (ML) has been used to create mappings for digital musical
    instruments for over twenty-five years, and numerous ML toolkits have been developed
    for the NIME community. However, little published work has studied how ML has
    been used in sustained instrument building and performance practices. This paper
    examines the experiences of instrument builder and performer Laetitia Sonami,

    Using Sonami’s current practice as a case study, this paper explores the utility,
    opportunities, and challenges involved in using ML in practice over many years.
    This paper also reports the perspective of Rebecca Fiebrink, the creator of the
    Wekinator ML tool used by Sonami, revealing how her work with Sonami has led to
    changes to the software and to her teaching. This paper thus contributes a deeper
    understanding of the value of ML for NIME practitioners, and it can inform design
    considerations for future ML toolkits as well as NIME pedagogy. Further, it provides
    new perspectives on familiar NIME conversations about mapping strategies, expressivity,
    and control, informed by a dedicated practice over many years.'

  abstract: 'This paper discusses the design of a musical synthesizer that takes words
    as input, and attempts to generate music that somehow underscores those words.
    This is considered as a tool for sound designers who could, for example, enter
    dialogue from a film script and generate appropriate back- ground music. The synthesizer
    uses emotional valence and arousal as a common representation between words and
    mu- sic. It draws on previous studies that relate words and mu- sical features
    to valence and arousal. The synthesizer was evaluated with a user study. Participants
    listened to music generated by the synthesizer, and described the music with words.
    The arousal of the words they entered was highly correlated with the intended
    arousal of the music. The same was, surprisingly, not true for valence. The synthesizer
    is online, at [redacted URL].'

  abstract: 'This paper brings together two main perspectives on algorithmic pattern.
    First, the writing of musical patterns in live coding performance, and second,
    the weaving of patterns in textiles. In both cases, algorithmic pattern is an
    interface between the human and the outcome, where small changes have far-reaching
    impact on the results. By bringing contemporary live coding and ancient textile
    approaches together, we reach a common view of pattern as algorithmic movement
    (e.g. looping, shifting, reflecting, interfering) in the making of things. This
    works beyond the usual definition of pattern used in musical interfaces, of mere
    repeating sequences. We conclude by considering the place of algorithmic pattern
    in a wider activity of making.'

    3 musical applications (Pitch wheel, Turntable and Exciter), by mapping sensors
    to sound synthesis in audio programming environment SuperCollider. While the original

    to conduct, given both the ethical implications and time commitments understandably
    required. The qualitative design process presented here recruits introductory
    teacher training students, towards discovering useful design insights relevant
    to music education technologies “by proxy”. Therefore, some of the barriers present
    in child-computer interaction research are avoided. As an example, the method
    is applied to the creation of a block-based music notation system, named Codetta.
    Building upon successful educational technologies that intersect both music and
    computer programming, Codetta seeks to enable child composition, whilst aiding
    generalist educator’s confidence in teaching music.'

  abstract: 'The exploration of musical robots has been an area of interest due to
    the timbral and mechanical advantages they offer for music generation and performance.
    However, one of the greatest challenges in mechatronic music is to enable these
    robots to deliver a nuanced and expressive performance. This depends on their
    capability to integrate dynamics, articulation, and a variety of ornamental techniques
    while playing a given musical passage. In this paper we introduce a robot arm
    pitch shifter for a mechatronic monochord prototype. This is a fast, precise,
    and mechanically quiet system that enables sliding techniques during musical performance.
    We discuss the design and construction process, as well as the system''s advantages
    and restrictions. We also review the quantitative evaluation process used to assess
    if the instrument meets the design requirements. This process reveals how the
    pitch shifter outperforms existing configurations, and potential areas of improvement

  abstract: 'This paper outlines the development process of an audio-visual gestural
    instrument—the AirSticks—and elaborates on the role ‘miming’ has played in the
    formation of new mappings for the instrument. The AirSticks, although fully-functioning,
    were used as props in live performances in order to evaluate potential mapping
    strategies that were later implemented for real. This use of mime when designing
    Digital Musical Instruments (DMIs) can help overcome choice paralysis, break from
    established habits, and liberate creators to realise more meaningful parameter
    mappings. Bringing this process into an interactive performance environment acknowledges
    the audience as stakeholders in the design of these instruments, and also leads
    us to reflect upon the beliefs and assumptions made by an audience when engaging
    with the performance of such ‘magical’ devices. This paper establishes two opposing
    strategies to parameter mapping, ‘movement-first’ mapping, and the less conventional
    ‘sound-first’ mapping that incorporates mime. We discuss the performance ‘One
    Five Nine’, its transformation from a partial mime into a fully interactive presentation,
    and the influence this process has had on the outcome of the performance and the

    ever heard before.   We argue that these advanced intelligence features on the

  abstract: 'Feedback instruments offer radical new ways of engaging with instrument
    design and musicianship. They are defined by recurrent circulation of signals
    through the instrument, which give the instrument ‘a life of its own’ and a ''stimulating
    uncontrollability''.  Arguably, the most interesting musical behaviour in these
    instruments happens when their dynamic complexity is maximised, without falling
    into saturating feedback. It is often challenging to keep the instrument in this
    zone; this research looks at algorithmic ways to manage the behaviour of feedback
    loops in order to make feedback instruments more playable and musical; to expand
    and maintain the `sweet spot''. We propose a solution that manages gain dynamics
    based on measurement of complexity, using a realtime implementation of the Effort
    to Compress algorithm. The system was evaluated with four musicians, each of whom
    have different variations of string-based feedback instruments, following an autobiographical
    design approach.  Qualitative feedback was gathered, showing that the system was
    successful in modifying the behaviour of these instruments to allow easier access
    to edge transition zones, sometimes at the expense of losing some of the more
    compelling dynamics of the instruments. The basic efficacy of the system is evidenced
    by descriptive audio analysis. This paper is accompanied by a dataset of sounds
    collected during the study, and the open source software that was written to support

    be intuitive for a neophyte audience (i.e., one without prior training or the

  abstract: 'We present SQUISHBOI, a continuous touch controller for interacting with
    complex musical systems. An elastic rubber membrane forms the playing surface
    of the instrument, while machine learning is used for dimensionality reduction
    and gesture recognition. The membrane is stretched over a hollow shell which permits
    considerable depth excursion, with an array of distance sensors tracking the surface
    displacement from underneath. The inherent dynamics of the membrane lead to cross-coupling
    between nearby sensors, however we do not see this as a flaw or limitation. Instead
    we find this coupling gives structure to the playing techniques and mapping schemes
    chosen by the user. The instrument is best utilized as a tool for actively designing
    abstraction and forming a relative control structure within a given system, one
    which allows for intuitive gestural control beyond what can be accomplished with

    a set of principles for interaction design focused on five force schemas: Path
    restraint, Containment restraint, Counter-force, Attraction, and Compulsion. We

    the convergence between the scientific understandings provided by the field of

  abstract: 'Our goal is to develop an improvisational ensemble support system for
    music beginners who do not have knowledge of chord progressions and do not have
    enough experience of playing an instrument. We hypothesized that a music beginner
    cannot determine tonal pitches of melody over a particular chord but can use body
    movements to specify the pitch contour (i.e., melodic outline) and the attack
    timings (i.e., rhythm). We aim to realize a performance interface for supporting
    expressing intuitive pitch contour and attack timings using body motion and outputting
    harmonious pitches over the chord progression of the background music. Since the
    intended users of this system are not limited to people with music experience,
    we plan to develop a system that uses Android smartphones, which many people have.
    Our system consists of three modules: a module for specifying attack timing using
    smartphone sensors, module for estimating the vertical movement of the smartphone
    using smartphone sensors, and module for estimating the sound height using smartphone
    vertical movement and background chord progression. Each estimation module is
    developed using long short-term memory (LSTM), which is often used to estimate
    time series data. We conduct evaluation experiments for each module. As a result,
    the attack timing estimation had zero misjudgments, and the mean error time of
    the estimated attack timing was smaller than the sensor-acquisition interval.
    The accuracy of the vertical motion estimation was 64%, and that of the pitch
    estimation was 7.6%. The results indicate that the attack timing is accurate enough,
    but the vertical motion estimation and the pitch estimation need to be improved
    for actual use.'

  abstract: 'Understanding the question of what makes a good musical instrument raises
    several conceptual challenges. Researchers have regularly adopted tools from traditional
    HCI as a framework to address this issue, in which instrumental musical activities
    are taken to comprise a device and a user, and should be evaluated as such. We
    argue that this approach is not equipped to fully address the conceptual issues
    raised by this question. It is worth reflecting on what exactly an instrument
    is, and how instruments contribute toward meaningful musical experiences. Based
    on a theoretical framework that incorporates ideas from ecological psychology,
    enactivism, and phenomenology, we propose an alternative approach to studying
    musical instruments. According to this approach, instruments are better understood
    in terms of processes rather than as devices, while musicians are not users, but
    rather agents in musical ecologies. A consequence of this reframing is that any
    evaluations of instruments, if warranted, should align with the specificities
    of the relevant processes and ecologies concerned. We present an outline of this
    argument and conclude with a description of a current research project to illustrate
    how our approach can shape the design and performance of a musical instrument

  abstract: 'Augmented instruments have been a widely explored research topic since
    the late 80s. The possibility to use sensors for providing an input for sound
    processing/synthesis units let composers and sound artist open up new ways for
    experimentation. Augmented Reality, by rendering virtual objects in the real world
    and by making those objects interactive (via some sensor-generated input), provides
    a new frame for this research field. In fact, the 3D visual feedback, delivering
    a precise indication of the spatial configuration/function of each virtual interface,
    can make the instrumental augmentation process more intuitive for the interpreter
    and more resourceful for a composer/creator: interfaces can change their behavior
    over time, can be reshaped, activated or deactivated. Each of these modifications
    can be made obvious to the performer by using strategies of visual feedback. In
    addition, it is possible to accurately sample space and to map it with differentiated
    functions. Augmenting interfaces can also be considered a visual expressive tool
    for the audience and designed accordingly: the performer’s point of view (or another
    point of view provided by an external camera) can be mirrored to a projector.
    This article will show some example of different designs of AR piano augmentation

  abstract: 'Whilst there is a large body of NIME papers that concentrate on the presentation
    of new technologies there are fewer papers that have focused on a longitudinal
    understanding of NIMEs in practice. This paper embodies the more recent acknowledgement
    of the importance of practice-based methods of evaluation [1,2,3,4] concerning
    the use of NIMEs within performance and the recognition that it is only within
    the situation of practice that the context is available to actually interpret
    and evaluate the instrument [2]. Within this context this paper revisits the Feral
    Cello performance system that was first presented at NIME 2017 [5]. This paper
    explores what has been learned through the artistic practice of performing and
    workshopping in this context by drawing heavily on the experiences of the performer/composer
    who has become an integral part of this project and co-author of this paper. The
    original philosophical context is also revisited and reflections are made on the
    tensions between this position and the need to ‘get something to work’. The authors
    feel the presentation of the semi-structured interview within the paper is the
    best method of staying truthful to Hayes understanding of musical improvisation
    as an enactive framework ‘in its ability to demonstrate the importance of participatory,
    relational, emergent, and embodied musical activities and processes’ [4].'

  abstract: 'Becoming a practical musician traditionally requires an extensive amount
    of preparatory work to master the technical and theoretical challenges of the
    particular instrument and musical style before being able to devote oneself to
    musical expression. In particular, in jazz improvisation, one of the major barriers
    is the mastery and appropriate selection of scales from a wide range, according
    to harmonic context and style. In this paper, we present AutoScale, an interactive
    software for making jazz improvisation more accessible by lifting the burden of
    scale selection from the musician while still allowing full controllability if
    desired. This is realized by implementing a MIDI effect that dynamically maps
    the desired scales onto a standardized layout. Scale selection can be pre-programmed,
    automated based on algorithmic lead sheet analysis, or interactively adapted.
    We discuss the music-theoretical foundations underlying our approach, the design
    choices taken for building an intuitive user interface, and provide implementations
    as VST plugin and web applications for use with a Launchpad or traditional MIDI
    keyboard.'

  abstract: 'Nearly two decades after its inception as a workshop at the ACM Conference
    on Human Factors in Computing Systems, NIME exists as an established international
    conference significantly distinct from its precursor. While this origin story
    is often noted, the implications of NIME''s history as emerging from a field predominantly
    dealing with human-computer interaction have rarely been discussed. In this paper
    we highlight many of the recent—and some not so recent—challenges that have been
    brought upon the NIME community as it attempts to maintain and expand its identity
    as a platform for multidisciplinary research into HCI, interface design, and electronic
    and computer music. We discuss the relationship between the market demands of
    the neoliberal university—which have underpinned academia''s drive for innovation—and
    the quantification and economisation of research performance which have facilitated
    certain disciplinary and social frictions to emerge within NIME-related research
    and practice. Drawing on work that engages with feminist theory and cultural studies,
    we suggest that critical reflection and moreover mediation is necessary in order
    to address burgeoning concerns which have been raised within the NIME discourse
    in relation to methodological approaches,''diversity and inclusion'', ''accessibility'',
    and the fostering of rigorous interdisciplinary research.'

  abstract: 'Digital musical instrument design is often presented as an open-ended
    creative process in which technology is adopted and adapted to serve the musical
    will of the designer. The real-time music programming languages powering many
    new instruments often provide access to audio manipulation at a low level, theoretically
    allowing the creation of any sonic structure from primitive operations. As a result,
    designers may assume that these seemingly omnipotent tools are pliable vehicles
    for the expression of musical ideas. We present the outcomes of a compositional
    game in which sound designers were invited to create simple instruments using
    common sensors and the Pure Data programming language. We report on the patterns
    and structures that often emerged during the exercise, arguing that designers
    respond strongly to suggestions offered by the tools they use. We discuss the
    idea that current music programming languages may be as culturally loaded as the
    communities of practice that produce and use them. Instrument making is then best
    viewed as a protracted negotiation between designer and tools.'

  abstract: 'Percussive fingerstyle is a playing technique adopted by many contemporary
    acoustic guitarists, and it has grown substantially in popularity over the last
    decade. Its foundations lie in the use of the guitar''s body for percussive lines,
    and in the extended range given by the novel use of altered tunings. There are
    very few formal accounts of percussive fingerstyle, therefore, we devised an interview
    study to investigate its approach to composition, performance and musical experimentation.
    Our aim was to gain insight into the technique from a gesture-based point of view,
    observe whether modern fingerstyle shares similarities to the approaches in NIME
    practice and investigate possible avenues for guitar augmentations inspired by
    the percussive technique. We conducted an inductive thematic analysis on the transcribed
    interviews: our findings highlight the participants'' material-based approach
    to musical interaction and we present a three-zone model of the most common percussive
    gestures on the guitar''s body. Furthermore, we examine current trends in Digital
    Musical Instruments, especially in guitar augmentation, and we discuss possible
    future directions in augmented guitars in light of the interviewees'' perspectives.'

  abstract: 'In the field of human computer interaction (HCI) the limitations of prototypes
    as the primary artefact used in research are being realised. Prototypes often
    remain open in their design, are partially-finished, and have a focus on a specific
    aspect of interaction. Previous authors have proposed `research products'' as
    a specific category of artefact distinct from both research prototypes and commercial
    products. The characteristics of research products are their holistic completeness
    as a design artefact, their situatedness in a specific cultural context, and the
    fact that they are evaluated for what they are, not what they will become. This
    paper discusses the ways in which many instruments created within the context
    of New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), including those that are used
    in performances, often fall into the category of prototype. We shall discuss why
    research products might be a useful framing for NIME research. Research products
    shall be weighed up against some of the main themes of NIME research: technological
    innovation; musical expression; instrumentality. We conclude this paper with a
    case study of Strummi, a digital musical instrument which we frame as research
    product.'

    of DIY, DIYness. We used the Studio Bench - a method that brings making, recording
    and performance together in one space - and viewed workshopping and performance
    as a holistic event. A range of methodologies were investigated in relation to
    NIME. These included the Hardware Mash-up, Speculative Sound Circuits and Reverse
    Design, from product to prototype, resulting in the instrument the Radical Nails.
    Finally, our work drew on the notion of design as performance and making in public

  abstract: 'This paper introduces a new method for direct control using the voice
    via measurement of vocal muscular activation with surface electromyography (sEMG).
    Digital musical interfaces based on the voice have typically used indirect control,
    in which features extracted from audio signals control the parameters of sound
    generation, for example in audio to MIDI controllers. By contrast, focusing on
    the musculature of the singing voice allows direct muscular control, or alternatively,
    combined direct and indirect control in an augmented vocal instrument. In this
    way we aim to both preserve the intimate relationship a vocalist has with their
    instrument and key timbral and stylistic characteristics of the voice while expanding
    its sonic capabilities. This paper discusses other digital instruments which effectively
    utilise a combination of indirect and direct control as well as a history of controllers
    involving the voice. Subsequently, a new method of direct control from physiological
    aspects of singing through sEMG and its capabilities are discussed. Future developments
    of the system are further outlined along with usage in performance studies, interactive
    live vocal performance, and educational and practice tools.'

  abstract: 'The popularity of applying machine learning techniques in musical domains
    has created an inherent availability of freely accessible pre-trained neural network
    (NN) models ready for use in creative applications. This work outlines the implementation
    of one such application in the form of an assistance tool designed for live improvisational
    performances by laptop ensembles. The primary intention was to leverage off-the-shelf
    pre-trained NN models as a basis for assisting individual performers either as
    musical novices looking to engage with more experienced performers or as a tool
    to expand musical possibilities through new forms of creative expression. The
    system expands upon a variety of ideas found in different research areas including
    new interfaces for musical expression, generative music and group performance
    to produce a networked performance solution served via a web-browser interface.
    The final implementation of the system offers performers a mixture of high and
    low-level controls to influence the shape of sequences of notes output by locally
    run NN models in real time, also allowing performers to define their level of
    engagement with the assisting generative models. Two test performances were played,
    with the system shown to feasibly support four performers over a four minute piece
    while producing musically cohesive and engaging music. Iterations on the design
    of the system exposed technical constraints on the use of a JavaScript environment
    for generative models in a live music context, largely derived from inescapable
    processing overheads.'

    with their own awareness ranging from the manipulation of abstract sound to the
    direct simulation of atmospheric phenomena - in the latter case, it could even
    be to revive memories or to create novel situations. This suggests that the approach

    at audio rate versus control rate, and how the level of detail in the signal–and
    the complexity of the mappings–influence the experience of control in the instrument.
    This is exemplified through reflections on four concerts in which RAW has been

  abstract: 'Previous research on musical embodiment has reported that expert performers
    often regard their instruments as an extension of their body. Not every digital
    musical instrument seeks to create a close relationship between body and instrument,
    but even for the many that do, the design process often focuses heavily on technical
    and sonic factors, with relatively less attention to the bodily experience of
    the performer. In this paper we propose Somaesthetic design as an alternative
    to explore this space. The Soma method aims to attune the sensibilities of designers,
    as well as their experience of their body, and make use of these notions as a
    resource for creative design. We then report on a series of workshops exploring
    the relationship between the body and the guitar with a Soma design approach.
    The workshops resulted in a series of guitar-related artefacts and NIMEs that
    emerged from the somatic exploration of balance and tension during guitar performance.
    Lastly we present lessons learned from our research that could inform future Soma-based
    musical instrument design, and how NIME research may also inform Soma design.'

    recordings, live performance and generative work across many genres of music making.
    The survey also gauged general attitudes towards AI in music and provided an open
    field for general comments. The responses to the survey suggested a forward-looking
    attitude to music AI with participants often pointing to the future potential
    of AI tools, rather than present utility. Optimism was partially related to programming
    skill with those with more experience showing higher skepticism towards the current

  abstract: 'Cycle is a software tool for musical composition and improvisation that
    represents events along a circular timeline. In doing so, it breaks from the linear
    representational conventions of European Art music and modern Digital Audio Workstations.
    A user specifies time points on different layers, each of which corresponds to
    a particular sound. The layers are superimposed on a single circle, which allows
    a unique visual perspective on the relationships between musical voices given
    their geometric positions. Positions in-between quantizations are possible, which
    encourages experimentation with expressive timing and machine rhythms. User-selected
    transformations affect groups of notes, layers, and the pattern as a whole. Past
    and future states are also represented, synthesizing linear and cyclical notions
    of time. This paper will contemplate philosophical questions raised by circular
    rhythmic notation and will reflect on the ways in which the representational novelties
    and editing functions of Cycle have inspired creativity in musical composition.'

  abstract: 'Creative systems such as algorithmic composers often use Artificial Intelligence
    models like Markov chains, Artificial Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms
    in order to model stochastic processes. Unconventional Computing (UC) technologies
    explore non-digital ways of data storage, processing, input, and output. UC paradigms
    such as Quantum Computing and Biocomputing delve into domains beyond the binary
    bit to handle complex non-linear functions. In this paper, we harness Physarum
    polycephalum as memristors to process and generate creative data for popular music.
    While there has been research conducted in this area, the literature lacks examples
    of popular music and how the organism''s non-linear behaviour can be controlled
    while composing music. This is important because non-linear forms of representation
    are not as obvious as conventional digital means. This study aims at disseminating
    this technology to non-experts and musicians so that they can incorporate it in
    their creative processes. Furthermore, it combines resistors and memristors to
    have more flexibility while generating music and optimises parameters for faster
    processing and performance. '

  abstract: 'PathoSonic is a VR experience that enables a participant to visualize
    and perform a sound file based on timbre feature descriptors displayed in space.
    The name comes from the different paths the participant can create through their
    sonic explorations. The goal of this research is to leverage affordances of virtual
    reality technology to visualize sound through different levels of performance-based
    interactivity that immerses the participant''s body in a spatial virtual environment.
    Through implementation of a multi-sensory experience, including visual aesthetics,
    sound, and haptic feedback, we explore inclusive approaches to sound visualization,
    making it more accessible to a wider audience including those with hearing, and
    mobility impairments. The online version of the paper can be accessed here: https://fdch.github.io/pathosonic'

  abstract: 'This paper investigates how the concept of score has been used in the
    NIME community. To this end, we performed a systematic literature review of the
    NIME proceedings, analyzing papers in which scores play a central role. We analyzed
    the score not as an object per se but in relation to the users and the interactive
    system(s). In other words, we primarily looked at the role that scores play in
    the performance ecology. For this reason, to analyze the papers, we relied on
    ARCAA, a recent framework created to investigate artifact ecologies in computer
    music performances. Using the framework, we created a scheme for each paper and
    clustered the papers according to similarities. Our analysis produced five main
    categories that we present and discuss in relation to literature about musical
    scores.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents the development of MapLooper: a live-looping system
    for gesture-to-sound mappings. We first reviewed loop-based Digital Musical Instruments
    (DMIs). We then developed a connectivity infrastructure for wireless embedded
    musical instruments with distributed mapping and synchronization. We evaluated
    our infrastructure in the context of the real-time constraints of music performance.
    We measured a round-trip latency of 4.81 ms when mapping signals at 100 Hz with
    embedded libmapper and an average inter-onset delay of 3.03 ms for synchronizing
    with Ableton Link. On top of this infrastructure, we developed MapLooper: a live-looping
    tool with 2 example musical applications: a harp synthesizer with SuperCollider
    and embedded source-filter synthesis with FAUST on ESP32. Our system is based
    on a novel approach to mapping, extrapolating from using FIR and IIR filters on
    gestural data to using delay-lines as part of the mapping of DMIs. Our system
    features rhythmic time quantization and a flexible loop manipulation system for
    creative musical exploration. We open-source all of our components.'

  abstract: 'Assessment of user experience (UX) is increasingly important in music
    interaction evaluation, as witnessed in previous NIME reviews describing varied
    and idiosyncratic evaluation strategies. This paper focuses on evaluations conducted
    in the last four years of NIME (2017 to 2020), compares results to previous research,
    and classifies evaluation types to describe how researchers approach and study
    UX in NIME. While results of this review confirm patterns such as the prominence
    of short-term, performer perspective evaluations, and the variety of evaluation
    strategies used, they also show that UX-focused evaluations are typically exploratory
    and limited to novice performers. Overall, these patterns indicate that current
    UX evaluation strategies do not address dynamic factors such as skill development,
    the evolution of the performer-instrument relationship, and hedonic and cognitive
    aspects of UX. To address such limitations, we discuss a number of less common
    tools developed within and outside of NIME that focus on dynamic aspects of UX,
    potentially leading to more informative and meaningful evaluation insights.'

    is identical to the regular six-hole recorder. In its electronic mode, the interface
    detects the player''s fingering and breath velocity and translates them to MIDI
    messages. Specifically, it maps higher breath velocity to higher octaves, with
    the modulo remainder controlling the microtonal pitch bend. This novel mapping
    reproduces a highly realistic flute-playing experience. Furthermore, changing

  abstract: 'Musical grid interfaces such as the monome grid have developed into standard
    interfaces for musical equipment over the last 15 years. However, the types of
    possible interactions more or less remained the same, only expanding grid capabilities

    to grid devices to expand their input capabilities by combining tangible and capacitive-touch
    based interaction paradigms. This enables to keep the generic nature of grid interfaces
    which is a key feature for many users. In this paper we present the TouchGrid

    We discuss the formulation of an environmental statement for the conference as
    well as the initiation of a NIME Eco Wiki containing information on environmental
    concerns related to the creation of new musical instruments. We outline a number
    of these concerns and, by systematically reviewing the proceedings of all previous
    NIME conferences, identify a general lack of reflection on the environmental impact
    of the research undertaken. Finally, we propose a framework for addressing the
    making, testing, using, and disposal of NIMEs in the hope that sustainability
    may become a central concern to researchers.'

  abstract: 'The Global Hyperorgan is an intercontinental, creative space for acoustic
    musicking. Existing pipe organs around the world are networked for real-time,
    geographically-distant performance, with performers utilizing instruments and
    other input devices to collaborate musically through the voices of the pipes in
    each location. A pilot study was carried out in January 2021, connecting two large
    pipe organs in Piteå, Sweden, and Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A quartet of performers
    tested the Global Hyperorgan’s capacities for telematic musicking through a series
    of pieces. The concept of modularity is useful when considering the artistic challenges
    and possibilities of the Global Hyperorgan. We observe how the modular system
    utilized in the pilot study afforded multiple experiences of shared instrumentality
    from which new, synthetic voices emerge. As a long-term technological, artistic
    and social research project, the Global Hyperorgan offers a platform for exploring
    technology, agency, voice, and intersubjectivity in hyper-acoustic telematic musicking.'

  abstract: 'The nature of digital musical instruments (DMIs), often bespoke artefacts
    devised by single or small groups of technologists, requires thought about how
    they are shared and archived so that others can replicate or adapt designs. The
    ability for replication contributes to an instrument’s longevity and creates opportunities
    for both DMI designers and researchers. Research papers often omit necessary knowledge
    for replicating research artefacts, but we argue that mitigating this situation
    is not just about including design materials and documentation. Our way of approaching
    this issue is by drawing on an age-old method as a way of disseminating knowledge,
    the apprenticeship. We propose the DMI apprenticeship as a way of exploring the
    procedural obstacles of replicating DMIs, while highlighting for both apprentice
    and designer the elements of knowledge that are a challenge to communicate in
    conventional documentation. Our own engagement with the DMI apprenticeship led
    to successfully replicating an instrument, Strummi. Framing this process as an
    apprenticeship highlighted the non-obvious areas of the documentation and manufacturing
    process that are crucial in the successful replication of a DMI.'

    a novel interface for the capture and use of biofeedback signals and physiological
    changes generated in the body by breathing, during singing. This NIME design is
    grounded in the performer''s experience of, and relationship to, their body and
    their voice. We show that NIME design using principles from soma design can offer
    creative opportunities in developing novel sensing mechanisms, which can in turn
    inform composition and further elicit curious engagements between performer and
    artefact, disrupting notions of performer-led control. As contributions, this
    work 1) offers an example of NIME design for situated living, feeling, performing

    presents SoftMRP, a Max/MSP patch designed to emulate the physical MRP and thereby
    to allow rehearsal of MRP repertoire and performance techniques using any MIDI

    will encourage even more widespread adoption of the original instrument amongst
    composers and performers. This paper explains SoftMRP’s features and limitations,
    discussing the challenges of approximating responses which rely upon the MRP’s
    continuous sensing of key position, and considering ways in which the development
    of the emulation might feed back into the development of the original instrument,
    both specifically and more broadly: since it was designed by a composer, based
    on his experience of writing for the instrument, it offers the MRP’s designers

  abstract: 'What is the relationship between a musician-designer''s auditory imagery
    for a musical piece, a design idea for an augmented instrument to support the
    realisation of that piece, and the aspiration to introduce the resulting instrument
    to a community of like-minded performers? We explore this NIME topic in the context
    of building the first iteration of an augmented acoustic guitar prototype for
    percussive fingerstyle guitarists. The first author, himself a percussive fingerstyle
    player, started the project of an augmented guitar with expectations and assumptions
    made around his own playing style, and in particular around the arrangement of
    one song. This input was complemented by the outcome of an interview study, in
    which percussive guitarists highlighted functional and creative requirements to
    suit their needs. We ran a pilot study to assess the resulting prototype, involving
    two other players. We present their feedback on two configurations of the prototype,
    one equalising the signal of surface sensors and the other based on sample triggering.
    The equalisation-based setting was better received, however both participants
    provided useful suggestions to improve the sample-triggering model following their
    own auditory imagery.'

  abstract: 'Audio and haptic sensations have previously been linked in the development

    kinds of interactive behaviors. The software utilizes corpora of solo instrumental
    performances encoded as self-organized maps and outputs slices of the corpora
    as concatenated, remodeled audio sequences. Transitions between behaviors can
    be automated, and the interface enables the negotiation of these transitions through
    feedback buttons that signal approval, force reversions to previous behaviors,
    or request change. Musical responses are embedded in a pre-trained latent space,
    emergent in the interaction, and influenced through the weighting of rhythmic,
    spectral, harmonic, and melodic features. The training and run-time modules utilize
    a modified version of the MASOM agent architecture. Our model stimulates spontaneous
    creativity and reduces the need for the user to sustain analytical mind frames,
    thereby optimizing flow. The agent traverses a system autonomy axis ranging from
    reactive to proactive, which includes the behaviors of shadowing, mirroring, and
    coupling. A fourth behavior—negotiation—is emergent from the interface between
    agent and user. The synergy of corpora, interactive modes, and influences induces
    musical responses along a musical similarity axis from converging to diverging.
    We share preliminary observations from experiments with the agent and discuss
    design challenges and future prospects.'

    in two performances and two workshops, where several ML models have been trained

  abstract: 'This paper presents Living Sounds, an internet radio station and online
    venue hosted by nature. The virtual space is animated by live sound from a restored
    wetland wildlife sanctuary, spatially mixed from dozens of 24/7 streaming microphones
    across the landscape. The station’s guests are invited artists and others whose
    performances are responsive to and contingent upon the ever-changing environmental
    sound. Subtle, sound-active drawings by different visual designers anchor the
    one-page website. Using low latency, high fidelity WebRTC, our system allows guests
    to mix themselves in, remix the raw nature streams, or run our multichannel sources
    fully through their own processors. Created in early 2020 in response to the locked
    down conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, the site became a virtual oasis, with
    usage data showing long duration visits. In collaboration with several festivals
    that went online in 2020, programmed live content included music, storytelling,
    and guided meditation. One festival commissioned a local microphone installation,
    resulting in a second nature source for the station: 5-channels of sound from
    a small Maine island. Catalyzed by recent events, when many have been separated
    from environments of inspiration and restoration, we propose Living Sounds as
    both a virtual nature space for cohabitation and a new kind of contingent online

  abstract: 'This article describes Mono-Replay, a software environment designed for
    sound animation. "Sound animation" in this context means musical performance based
    on various modes of replay and transformation of all kinds of recorded music samples.
    Sound animation using Mono-Replay is a two-step process, including an off-line
    analysis phase and on-line performance or synthesis phase. The analysis phase
    proceeds with time segmentation, and the set up of anchor points corresponding
    to temporal musical discourse parameters (notes, pulses, events). This allows,
    at the performance phase, for control of timing, playback position, playback speed,
    and a variety of spectral effects, with the help of gesture interfaces. Animation
    principles and software features of Mono-Replay are described. Two examples of
    sound animation based on beat tracking and transient detection algorithms are
    presented (a multi-track record of Superstition by Steve Wonder and Jeff Beck
    and Accidents/Harmoniques, an electroacoustic piece by Bernard Parmegiani). With
    the help of these two contrasted examples, the fundamental principles of “sound

    gestural control and interaction for animation at the performance stage.'

  abstract: 'Wireless sensor-based technologies are becoming increasingly accessible
    and widely explored in interactive musical performance due to their ubiquity and
    low-cost, which brings the necessity of understanding the capabilities and limitations
    of these sensors. This is usually approached by using a reference system, such
    as an optical motion capture system, to assess the signals’ properties. However,
    this process raises the issue of synchronizing the signal and the reference data
    streams, as each sensor is subject to different latency, time drift, reference
    clocks and initialization timings. This paper presents an empirical quantification
    of the latency communication stages in a setup consisting of a Qualisys optical
    motion capture (mocap) system and a wireless microcontroller-based sensor device.
    We performed event-to-end tests on the critical components of the hybrid setup
    to determine the synchronization suitability. Overall, further synchronization
    is viable because of the near individual average latencies of around 25ms for
    both the mocap system and the wireless sensor interface.'

  abstract: 'The work presented here is based on the Hybrid Augmented Saxophone of
    Gestural Symbioses (HASGS) system with a focus on and its evolution over the last
    five years, and an emphasis on its functional structure and the repertoire. The
    HASGS system was intended to retain focus on the performance of the acoustic instrument,
    keeping gestures centralised within the habitual practice of the instrument, and
    reducing the use of external devices to control electronic parameters in mixed
    music. Taking a reduced approach, the technology chosen to prototype HASGS was
    developed in order to serve the aesthetic intentions of the pieces being written
    for it. This strategy proved to avoid an overload of solutions that could bring
    artefacts and superficial use of the augmentation processes, which sometimes occur
    on augmented instruments, specially prototyped for improvisational intentionality.
    Here, we discuss how the repertoire, hardware, and software of the system can
    be mutually affected by this approach. We understand this project as an empirically-based
    study which can both serve as a model for analysis, as well provide composers
    and performers with pathways and creative strategies for the development of augmentation
    processes.'

    many constraints inherent to physical interfaces. In particular, the size and
    position of the interface components of Immersive Virtual Musical Instruments
    (IVMIs) can be freely chosen to elicit large or small hand gestures. In addition,
    VR allows for the manipulation of what users visually perceive of their actual

    Visual and gestural amplitudes can therefore be defined separately, potentially
    affecting the user experience in new ways. In this paper, we investigate the use
    of CDR to enrich the design with a control over the user perceived fatigue, sense
    of presence and musical expression. Our findings suggest that the CDR has an impact
    on the sense of presence, on the perceived difficulty of controlling the sound

  abstract: 'The CHILLER (a Computer-Human Interface for the Live Labeling of Emotional
    Responses) is a prototype of an affordable and easy-to-use wearable sensor for
    the real-time detection and visualization of one of the most accurate biomarkers
    of musical emotional processing:  the piloerection of the skin (i.e., the goosebumps)
    that accompany musical chills (also known as musical frissons or shivers down
    the spine). In controlled laboratory experiments, electrodermal activity (EDA)
    has been traditionally used to measure fluctuations of musical emotion. EDA is,
    however, ill-suited for real-world settings (e.g., live concerts) because of its
    sensitivity to movement, electronic noise and variations in the contact between
    the skin and the recording electrodes. The CHILLER, based on the Raspberry Pi

    of detecting goosebumps from a video recording of a patch of skin. The CHILLER

  abstract: 'Creating an artificially intelligent (AI) aid for music composers requires
    a practical and modular approach, one that allows the composer to manipulate the
    technology when needed in the search for new sounds. Many existing approaches
    fail to capture the interest of composers as they are limited beyond their demonstrative
    purposes, allow for only minimal interaction from the composer or require GPU
    access to generate samples quickly. This paper introduces Score-Transformer (ST),
    a practical integration of deep learning technology to aid in the creation of
    new music which works seamlessly alongside any popular software notation (Finale,
    Sibelius, etc.). Score-Transformer is built upon a variant of the powerful transformer
    model, currently used in state-of-the-art natural language models. Owing to hierarchical
    and sequential similarities between music and language, the transformer model
    can learn to write polyphonic MIDI music based on any styles, genres, or composers
    it is trained upon. This paper briefly outlines how the model learns and later
    notates music based upon any prompt given to it from the user. Furthermore, ST
    can be updated at any time on additional MIDI recordings minimizing the risk of
    the software becoming outdated or impractical for continued use.'

  abstract: 'We propose and evaluate an approach to incorporating multiple user-provided
    inputs, each demonstrating a complementary set of musical characteristics, to
    guide the output of a generative model for synthesizing short music performances
    or loops. We focus on user inputs that describe both “what to play” (via scores
    in MIDI format) and “how to play it” (via rhythmic inputs to specify expressive
    timing and dynamics). Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method can
    facilitate human-AI co-creation of drum loops with diverse and customizable outputs.
    In the process, we argue for the interaction paradigm of mapping by demonstration

    A multichannel sound field can be easily generated and modulated by placing several

    by repositioning, moving or grouping the sound modules. Although not physically

  abstract: 'Music education is an important part of the school curriculum; it teaches
    children to be creative and to collaborate with others. Music gives individuals
    another medium to communicate through, which is especially important for individuals
    with cognitive or physical disabilities. Teachers of children with severe disabilities
    have expressed a lack of musical instruments adapted for these children, which
    leads to an incomplete music education for this group. This study aims at designing
    and evaluating a set of collaborative musical instruments for children with cognitive
    and physical disabilities, and the research is done together with the special
    education school Rullen in Stockholm, Sweden. The process was divided into three
    main parts; a pre-study, building and designing, and finally a user study. Based
    on findings from previous research, together with input received from teachers
    at Rullen during the pre-study, the resulting design consists of four musical
    instruments that are connected to a central hub. The results show that the instruments
    functioned as intended and that the design makes musical learning accessible in
    a way traditional instruments do not, as well as creates a good basis for a collaborative
    musical experience. However, fully evaluating the effect of playing together requires
    more time for the children to get comfortable with the instruments and also for
    the experiment leaders to test different setups to optimize the conditions for
    a good interplay.'

  abstract: 'As technologies and interfaces for the instrumental control of musical
    sound get ever better at tracking aspects of human position and motion in space,
    a fundamental problem emerges: Unintended or even counter-intentional control
    may result when humans themselves become a source of positional noise. A clear
    case of what is meant by this, is the “stillness movement” of a body part, occurring
    despite the simultaneous explicit intention for that body part to remain still.
    In this paper, we present the results of a randomized, controlled experiment investigating
    this phenomenon along a vertical axis relative to the human fingertip. The results
    include characterizations of both the spatial distribution and frequency distribution
    of the stillness movement observed. Also included are results indicating a possible
    role for constant forces and viscosities in reducing stillness movement amplitude,
    thereby potentially enabling the implementation of more positional control of
    musical sound within the same available spatial range. Importantly, the above
    is summarized in a form that is directly interpretable for anyone designing technologies,
    interactions, or performances that involve fingertip control of musical sound.
    Also, a complete data set of the experimental results is included in the separate
    Appendices to this paper, again in a format that is directly interpretable.'

  abstract: 'Over past editions of the NIME Conference, there has been a growing concern
    towards diversity and inclusion. It is relevant for an international community
    whose vast majority of its members are in Europe, the USA, and Canada to seek
    a richer cultural diversity. To contribute to a decolonial perspective in the
    inclusion of underrepresented countries and ethnic/racial groups, we discuss Gambiarra
    and Techno-Vernacular Creativity concepts. We believe these concepts may help
    structure and stimulate individuals from these underrepresented contexts to perform
    research in the NIME field.'

  abstract: 'Digital musical instrument (DMI) design and performance is primarily
    practiced by those with backgrounds in music technology and human-computer interaction.
    Research on these topics is rarely led by performers, much less by those without
    backgrounds in technology. In this study, we explore DMI design and performance
    from the perspective of a singular community of classically-trained percussionists.
    We use a practiced-based methodology informed by our skillset as percussionists
    to study how instrumental skills and sensibilities can be incorporated into the
    personalization of, and performance with, DMIs. We introduced a simple and adaptable
    digital musical instrument, built using the Arduino Uno, that individuals (percussionists)
    could personalize and extend in order to improvise, compose and create music (études).
    Our analysis maps parallel percussion practices emerging from the resultant DMI
    compositions and performances by examining the functionality of each Arduino instrument
    through the lens of material-oriented and communication-oriented approaches to
    interactivity.'

  abstract: 'Recent work in NIME has questioned the political and social implications
    of work in this field, and has called for direct action on problems in the areas
    of diversity, representation and political engagement. Though there is motivation
    to address these problems, there is an open question of how to meaningfully do
    so. This paper proposes that NIME’s historical record is the best tool for understanding
    our own output but this record is incomplete, and makes the case for collective
    action to improve how we document our work. I begin by contrasting NIME’s output
    with its discourse, and explore the nature of this discourse through NIME history
    and examine our inherited epistemological complexity. I assert that, if left unexamined,
    this complexity can undermine our community values of diversity and inclusion.
    I argue that meaningfully addressing current problems demands critical reflection
    on our work, and explore how NIME’s historical record is currently used as a means
    of doing so. I then review what NIME''s historical record contains (and what it
    does not), and evaluate its fitness for use as a tool of inquiry. Finally I make
    the case for collective action to establish better documentation practices, and
    suggest features that may be helpful for the process as well as the result.'

    AI-terity is a deformable, non-rigid musical instrument that comprises a particular
    artificial intelligence (AI) method for generating audio samples for real-time
    audio synthesis. As an improvement, we developed the control interface structure
    with additional sensor hardware. In addition, we implemented a new hybrid deep
    learning architecture, GANSpaceSynth, in which we applied the GANSpace method
    on the GANSynth model. Following the deep learning model improvement, we developed
    new autonomous features for the instrument that aim at keeping the musician in
    an active and uncertain state of exploration. Through these new features, the
    instrument enables more accurate control on GAN latent space. Further, we intend
    to investigate the current developments through a musical composition that idiomatically
    reflects the new autonomous features of the AI-terity instrument. We argue that
    the present technology of AI is suitable for enabling alternative autonomous features
    in audio domain for the creative practices of musicians.'

  abstract: 'A novel, high-fidelity, shape-sensing technology, BendShape [1], is investigated
    as an expressive music controller for sound effects, direct sound manipulation,
    and voice synthesis. Various approaches are considered for developing mapping
    strategies that create transparent metaphors to facilitate expression for both
    the performer and the audience. We explore strategies in the input, intermediate,
    and output mapping layers using a two-step approach guided by Perry’s Principles
     [2]. First, we use trial-and-error to establish simple mappings between single
    input parameter control and effects to identify promising directions for further
    study. Then, we compose a specific piece that supports different uses of the BendShape
    mappings in a performance context: this allows us to study a performer trying
    different types of expressive techniques, enabling us to analyse the role each
    mapping has in facilitating musical expression. We also investigate the effects
    these mapping strategies have on performer bandwidth. Our main finding is that
    the high fidelity of the novel BendShape sensor facilitates creating interpretable
    input representations to control sound representations, and thereby match interpretations
    that provide better expressive mappings, such as with vocal shape to vocal sound
    and bumpiness control; however, direct mappings of individual, independent sensor
    mappings to effects does not provide obvious advantages over simpler controls.
    Furthermore, while the BendShape sensor enables rich explorations for sound, the
    ability to find expressive interpretable shape-to-sound representations while
    respecting the performer’s bandwidth limitations (caused by having many coupled
    input degrees of freedom) remains a challenge and an opportunity.'

  abstract: 'Debris is a playful interface for direct manipulation of audio waveforms.
    Audio data is represented as a collection of waveform elements, which provide
    a low-resolution visualisation of the audio sample. Each element, however, can
    be individually examined, re-positioned, or broken down into smaller fragments,
    thereby becoming a tangible representation of a moment in the sample. Debris is
    built around the idea of looking at a sound not as a linear event to be played
    from beginning to end, but as a non-linear collection of moments, timbres, and
    sound fragments which can be explored, closely examined and interacted with. This
    paper positions the work among conceptually related NIME interfaces, details the
    various user interactions and their mappings and ends with a discussion around
    the interface’s constraints.'

  abstract: 'Musical audio synthesis often requires systems-level knowledge and uniquely
    analytical approaches to music making, thus a number of machine learning systems
    have been proposed to replace traditional parameter spaces with more intuitive
    control spaces based on spatial arrangement of sonic qualities. Some prior evaluations
    of simplified control spaces have shown increased user efficacy via quantitative
    metrics in sound design tasks, and some indicate that simplification may lower
    barriers to entry to synthesis. However, the level and nature of the appeal of
    simplified interfaces to synthesists merits investigation, particularly in relation
    to the type of task, prior expertise, and aesthetic values. Toward addressing
    these unknowns, this work investigates user experience in a sample of 20 musicians
    with varying degrees of synthesis expertise, and uses a one-week, at-home, multi-task
    evaluation of a novel instrument presenting a simplified mode of control alongside
    the full parameter space. We find that our participants generally give primacy
    to parameter space and seek understanding of parameter-sound relationships, yet
    most do report finding some creative utility in timbre-space control for discovery
    of sounds, timbral transposition, and expressive modulations of parameters. Although
    we find some articulations of particular aesthetic values, relationships to user
    experience remain difficult to characterize generally.'

  abstract: 'The basic role of DJs is creating a seamless sequence of music tracks.
    In order to make the DJ mix a single continuous audio stream, DJs control various
    audio effects on a DJ mixer system particularly in the transition region between
    one track and the next track and modify the audio signals in terms of volume,
    timbre, tempo, and other musical elements. There have been research efforts to
    imitate the DJ mixing techniques but they are mainly rule-based approaches based
    on domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a method to analyze the DJ mixer
    control from real-world DJ mixes toward a data-driven approach to imitate the
    DJ performance. Specifically, we estimate the mixing gain trajectories between
    the two tracks using sub-band analysis with constrained convex optimization. We
    evaluate the method by reconstructing the original tracks using the two source
    tracks and the gain estimate, and show that the proposed method outperforms the
    linear crossfading as a baseline and the single-band analysis. A listening test
    from the survey of 14 participants also confirms that our proposed method is superior

    control systems and embedded musical information retrieval processes can afford

    along with the firmware of the embedded MIR system. The result is a new desktop

  abstract: 'This paper discusses a new approach to acoustic amplitude modulation.
    Building on prior work with electromagnetic augmentation of acoustic instruments,
    we begin with a theory of operation model to describe the mechanical forces necessary
    to produce acoustic amplitude modulation synthesis. We then propose an implementation
    of our model as an instrumental prototype. The results illustrate that our acoustic
    amplitude modulation system produces controllable sideband components, and that
    synthesis generated from our corresponding numerical dynamic system model closely
    approximates the acoustic result of the physical system.'

    This demonstration describes Tango, software for
    Computer-Human Improvisation developed for more than 25 years by Henning Berg.
    Tango listens to an improvising musician, analyses what it hears
    and plays musical responses which relate directly to the musical input.
    If the improviser in turn reacts to these answers, a musical loop between the
    human and the machine can emerge. The way input and reaction correlate and the
    predictability of Tango's responses can be defined by the user via a setup
    of improvising environments, called Rooms.
    Real-time sampling with knowledge of the musical content behind the samples and
    Midi-handling are unified via Tango's own monophonic audio-to-Midi, time
    stretching and pitch shifting algorithms. Both audio and Midi can be used by
    Tango's modules (e.g. Listeners, Players, Modifiers, Metronomes or Harmony)
    for input and output.
    A flexible real time control system allows for internal and external remote
    control and scaling of most parameters.
    The free software for Windows7 with all necessary folders, English and German
    manuals, many example-Rooms and a few videos can be downloaded at

    We present a sonification platform for generating audio driven by
    real-time particle collision data from the ATLAS experiment at CERN. This paper
    provides a description of the data-to-audio mapping interfaces supported by the
    project's composition tool as well as a preliminary evaluation of the platform's
    evolution to meet the aesthetic needs of vastly distinct musical styles and
    presentation venues. Our work has been conducted in collaboration with the ATLAS
    Outreach team and is part of a broad vision to better harness real-time sensor
    data as a canvas for artistic expression. Data-driven streaming audio can be
    treated as a reimagined form of live radio for which composers craft the
    instruments but real-time particle collisions pluck the strings.

  abstract: "Digitalization has enabled material decoupling of sound from the\nphysical\
    \ devices traditionally used to conceive it. This paper reports an\nartistic exploration\
    \ of novel mappings between everyday objects and digital\nsound. The Wheel Quintet---a\
    \ novel musical instrument comprising four\nbicycle wheels and a skateboard---was\
    \ created using off-the-shelf\ncomponents and visual programming in Max/MSP. The\
    \ use of everyday objects sought\nto enable people to quickly master the instrument,\
    \ regardless of their musical\nbackgrounds, and collectively create polytempic\
    \ musical textures in a\nparticipatory art context. Applying an action research\

  abstract: 'An entertainment environment to enrich music listening experience is
    purposed. This environment is composed of 3 modules: a MIDI player, a music animation
    and a haptic module that translates the notes played by one instrument into a
    resemblant vibration. To create the haptic vibration, the notes'' relative pitch
    in the song are calculated, then these positions are mapped into the haptic signals''
    amplitude and frequency. Also, the envelope of the haptic signal is modified,
    by using an ADSR filter, to have the same envelope as the audio signal. To evaluate
    the perceived cross-modal similarity between users, two experiments were performed.
    In both, the users used the complete entertainment environment to rank the similarity
    between 3 different haptic signals, with triangular, square and analogue envelopes
    and 4 different instruments in a classical song. The first experiment was performed
    with the purposed amplitude and frequency technique, while the second experiment
    was performed with constant frequency and amplitude. Results, show different envelope
    user preferences. The square and triangular envelopes were preferred in the first
    experiment, while only analogue envelopes were preferred in the second. This suggests
    that the users'' envelope perception was masked by the changes in amplitude and
    frequency.'

  abstract: 'Notation systems are used in almost all fields, especially for the communication
    and expression of ideas. This paper proposes and discusses a notation system for
    Gametrak-based computer music instruments. The notation system''s design is informed
    both by Western music notation and dance notation, as well as common mappings
    used in laptop orchestras. It is designed to be sound-agnostic, primarily instructing
    the performer in their motions. While the discussion of such a notation system
    may be particularly timely due to the growing commercially-available 3D motion
    tracking controllers, the notation system may prove especially useful in the context
    of Gametrak and laptop orchestra, for which score-based representation can help
    clarify performer interaction and serve as a teaching tool in documenting prior

  abstract: "Most instruments traditionally used to teach music in early\neducation,\
    \ like xylophones or flutes, encumber children with the additional\ndifficulty\
    \ of an unfamiliar and unnatural interface. The most simple expressive\ninteraction,\
    \ that even the smallest children use in order to make music, is\npounding at\
    \ surfaces. Through the design of an instrument with a simple\ninterface, like\
    \ a drum, but which produces a melodic sound, children can be\nprovided with an\
    \ easy and intuitive means to produce consonance. This should then\nbe further\
    \ complemented with information from analysis and interpretation of\nchildlike\
    \ gestures and dance moves, reflecting their natural understanding\nof musical\
    \ structure and motion. Based on these assumptions we propose a modular\nand reactive\

    \ plugins usable in a standard digital audio workstation. This paper\ndescribes\
    \ our concept and how it can facilitate access to collaborative music\nmaking\

    Cloud services allow musicians and developers to build audience
    participation software with minimal network configuration for audience and no
    need for server-side development. In this paper we discuss how a cloud service
    supported the audience participation music performance, Crowd in C[loud], which
    enables audience participation on a large scale using the audience audience's
    smartphones.
    We present the detail of the cloud service technology and an analysis of the
    network transaction data regarding the performance.
    This helps us to understand the nature of cloud-based audience participation
    pieces based on the characteristics of a performance reality and provides cues
    about the technology's scalability.

    This article presents observations and strategies for designing
    game-like elements for expressive mobile musical interactions. The designs of
    several popular commercial mobile music instruments are discussed and compared,
    along with the different ways they integrate musical information and game-like
    elements. In particular, issues of designing goals, rules, and interactions are
    balanced with articulating expressiveness. These experiences aim to invite and
    engage users with game design while maintaining and encouraging open-ended
    musical expression and exploration. A set of observations is derived, leading to
    a broader design motivation and philosophy.

    In this paper, we investigate how watching a live-sequenced
    electronic music performance, compared to merely hearing the music, contributes
    to spectators' experiences of tension. We also explore the role of the
    performers' effective and ancillary gestures in conveying tension, when they can
    be seen. To this end, we conducted an experiment where 30 participants heard,
    saw, or both heard and saw a live-sequenced techno music performance recording
    while they produced continuous judgments on their experience of tension. Eye
    tracking data was also recorded from participants who saw the visuals, to reveal
    aspects of the performance that influenced their tension judgments. We analysed
    the data to explore how auditory and visual components and the performer's
    movements contribute to spectators' experience of tension. Our results show that
    their perception of emotional intensity is consistent across hearing and sight,
    suggesting that gestures in live-sequencing can be a medium
    for expressive performance.

    in shaping audience response to digital musical instrument (DMI) performances.\
    \ In\nan audience study conducted during an evening concert, we examined two primary\n\
    questions: first, whether a deeper understanding of how a DMI works increases\
    \ an\naudience's enjoyment and interest in the performance; and second, given\
    \ the same\nDMI and same performer, whether playing in a conventional (vernacular)\

    \ a concert in\nwhich two DMI creator-performers each played two pieces in differing\
    \ styles.\nBefore the concert, each half the 64-person audience was given a technical\n\
    explanation of one of the instruments. Results showed that receiving an\nexplanation\
    \ increased the reported understanding of that instrument, but had no\neffect\
    \ on either the reported level of interest or enjoyment. On the other hand,\n\
    performances in experimental versus conventional style on the same instrument\n\

    The process of typing a poem on the fly is captured and augmented to create an

    Live writing draws upon ideas from the tradition of live coding in which the process

    the motivation behind the idea, interaction schemes and a performance interface

    The majority of electronic percussion controllers on the market
    today are based on location-oriented striking techniques, resulting in a finger
    drumming interaction paradigm, that is both fundamentally eclectic as well as
    imposingly contr. The few controllers that allow hand-drumming
    techniques also invariably conform to region-based triggering design, or, in
    trade-off for expressivity, end up excluding hardware connectivity options that
    are vital to the context of the modern electronic rhythm producer. The HandSolo
    is a timbre-based drum controller that allows the use of natural, hand-drumming
    strokes, whilst offering the same end-goal functionality that percussion
    controller users have come to expect over the past decade.

    \ of audience-visible interaction: mapping and performance\nstrategies applied\
    \ to express audiovisual interactions with multilayered\nsound-image relationships.\
    \ The system received positive feedback from 34 audience\nparticipants on aspects\

  abstract: "This project explores the potential for 3D modelling and printing\nto\
    \ create customised flutes that can play music in a variety of microtonal\nscales.\
    \ One of the challenges in the field of microtonality is that conventional\nmusical\
    \ instruments are inadequate for realising the abundance of theoretical\ntunings\
    \ that musicians wish to investigate. This paper focuses on the development\n\
    of two types of flutes, the recorder and transverse flute, with interchangeable\n\
    mouthpieces. These flutes are designed to play subharmonic microtonal scales.\
    \ The\ndiscussion provides an overview of the design and implementation process,\n\
    including calculation methods for acoustic modelling and 3D printing\ntechnologies,\
    \ as well as an evaluation of some of the difficulties encountered.\nResults from\

    \ in our designs, 3D modelling and printing techniques offer new and\nvaluable\
    \ methods for the design and production of customised musical instruments.\nThe\

    \ and live performing, through gesture\nsonification, as a unified user experience.\
    \ The deeper understanding of the\nexpressive gestural variations permits to define\
    \ the confidence bounds of the\nexpert's gestures, which are used during the decoding\
    \ phase of the\nrecognition. The first experiments show promising results in terms\
    \ of recognition\naccuracy and temporal alignment between template and performed\

     NIMEs typically focus on novelty but the cost of novelty is
    often to
    ignore other non-functional requirements and concerns such as
    usability or security. Digital security has probably not been a
    concern for performers due to the duration of their performances and
    lack of disrespectful hackers, known as crackers, in attendance
    carrying the appropriate equipment and software necessary to hack a
    performance. Yet many modern NIMEs could be hacked from smart-phones
    in the audience. The lack of security hardening makes NIMEs an easy
    target --- but a question arises: if hacking can interrupt or modify
    a performance couldn't hacking itself also be performance? Thus
    would music hacking, live-hacking, be similar to live-coding? In
    this paper we discuss how NIMEs are in danger of being hacked, and
    yet how hacking can be an act of performance too.

    Following the techniques of user-centered interaction design, an international
    group of beat producers was reviewed on the possibility of using AI algorithms
    to help them in the beat production workflow. The analyzed results of these tests
    were used as design requirements for constructing a system that would indeed perform
    some tasks alongside the producer. The first results of this working prototype
    are presented with a description of the system. The prototype is a stylistic drum
    generator that creates new rhythmic patterns after being trained with a collection
    of drum tracks. Further stages of development and potential algorithms are discussed.'

    This paper discusses practice-based research in the context of
    live performance with interactive systems. We focus on two approaches, both of
    which are concerned with documenting, examining and reflecting on the real-world
    behaviours and experiences of people and artefacts involved in the creation of
    new works. The first approach is primarily based on reflections by an individual
    performer/developer (auto-ethnography) and the second on interviews and
    observations. The rationales for both approaches are presented along with
    findings from research which applied them in order to illustrate and explore the
    characteristics of both. Challenges, including the difficulty of balancing
    rigour and relevance and the risks of negatively impacting on creative practices
    are articulated, as are the potential benefits.

    This paper documents a method of controlling complex sound
    synthesis processes such as granular synthesis, additive synthesis, timbre

    spatialisation via a multi-parametric 2D interface. This paper evaluates the use
    of audio-rate control signals for sound synthesis, and discussing approaches to
    de-interleaving, synchronization, and mapping. The paper also outlines a number
    of ways of extending the expressivity of such a control interface by coupling
    this with another 2D multi-parametric nodes interface and audio-rate 2D table
    lookup. The paper proceeds to review methods of navigating multi-parameter sets
    via interpolation and transformation. Some case studies are finally discussed in
    the paper. The author has used this method to control complex sound synthesis
    processes that require control data for more that a thousand parameters.

    \ In\nthe workshop on music, space and interaction we thus developed the idea\

    \ source\non a panning trajectory. We define a series of application scenarios\
    \ where we\ndescribe in detail what functionality is required to inform an implementation.\
    \ In\nour earlier work we showed that Acoustic Localisation (AL) potentially can\n\
    provide a pervasive technique for spatially interactive audio applications.\n\
    Playing through the application scenarios with AL in mind provides interesting\n\
    approaches. For one scenario we show an example implementation as proof of\nconcept."

    upon critical work in philosophy, anthropology and aesthetics, and practically
    upon previous explorations of strategies for facilitating rapid, collaborative,
    publicly-oriented making in artistic settings. We explored an orientation to making
    which promoted the creation of a family of instruments and performance environments
    that were responses to the self-consciously provocative theme of `One Knob To
    Rule Them All''. A variety of design issues were explored including: mapping,
    physicality, the question of control in interface design, reductionist aesthetics
    and design strategies, and questions of gender and power in musical culture. We
    discuss not only the technologies which were made but also reflect on the value
    of such concerted, provocatively thematised, collective making activities for
    addressing foundational design issues. As such, our work is intended not just
    as a technical and practical contribution to NIME but also a reflective provocation

    In this paper we present the new development of a semi-autonomous
    response module for the NOISA system. NOISA is an interactive music system that
    predicts performer's engagement levels, learns from the performer, decides what
    to do and does it at the right moment. As an improvement for the above, we
    implemented real-time adaptive features that respond to a detailed monitoring of
    the performer's engagement and to overall sonic space, while evaluating the
    impact of its actions. Through these new features, the response module produces
    meaningful and non-intrusive counter actions, attempting to deepen and maintain
    the performer's engagement in musical interaction. In a formative study we
    compared our designed response module against a random control system of events,
    in which the former performed consistently better than the latter.

  abstract: 'This paper presents the latest developments of the Public Sound Objects
    (PSOs) system, an experimental framework to implement and test new concepts for
    Networked Music. The project of a Public interactive installation using the PSOs
    system was commissioned in 2007 by Casa da Musica, the main concert hall space
    in Porto. It resulted in a distributed musical structure with up to ten interactive
    performance terminals distributed along the Casa da Musica''s hallways, collectively
    controlling a shared acoustic piano. The installation allows the visitors to collaborate
    remotely with each other, within the building, using a software interface custom
    developed to facilitate collaborative music practices and with no requirements
    in terms previous knowledge of musical performance. '

  abstract: 'New application spaces and artistic forms can emerge whenusers are freed
    from constraints. In the general case ofhuman-computer interfaces, users are often
    confined to afixed location, severely limiting mobility. To overcome thisconstraint
    in the context of musical interaction, we presenta system to manage large-scale
    collaborative mobile audioenvironments, driven by user movement. Multiple participants
    navigate through physical space while sharing overlaid virtual elements. Each
    user is equipped with a mobilecomputing device, GPS receiver, orientation sensor,
    microphone, headphones, or various combinations of these technologies. We investigate
    methods of location tracking, wireless audio streaming, and state management between
    mobiledevices and centralized servers. The result is a system thatallows mobile
    users, with subjective 3-D audio rendering,to share virtual scenes. The audio
    elements of these scenescan be organized into large-scale spatial audio interfaces,thus
    allowing for immersive mobile performance, locativeaudio installations, and many
    new forms of collaborativesonic activity.'

    In this paper, we describe a computer-based notation and gestural control system

    time. We describe how the problem was approached, drawing upon feedback and suggestions
    from consultations across multiple disciplines, seeking analogous problems in

  abstract: 'It started with an idea to create an empty space in which you activated
    music and light as you moved around. In responding to the music and lighting you
    would activate more or different sounds and thereby communicate with the space
    through your body. This led to an artistic research project in which children''s
    spontaneous movement was observed, a choreography made based on the children''s
    movements and music written and recorded for the choreography. This music was
    then decomposed and choreographed into an empty space at Botkyrka konsthall creating
    an interactive dance installation. It was realized using an interactive sound
    and light system in which 5 video cameras were detecting the motion in the room
    connected to a 4-channel sound system and a set of 14 light modules. During five
    weeks people of all ages came to dance and move around in the installation. The
    installation attracted a wide range of people of all ages and the tentative evaluation
    indicates that it was very positively received and that it encouraged free movement
    in the intended way. Besides observing the activity in the installation interviews
    were made with schoolchildren age 7 who had participated in the installation. '

  abstract: 'This paper presents an agent-based architecture for robotic musical instruments
    that generate polyphonic rhythmic patterns that continuously evolve and develop
    in a musically "intelligent" manner. Agent-based software offers a new method
    for real-time composition that allows for complex interactions between individual
    voices while requiring very little user interaction or supervision. The system
    described, Kinetic Engine, is an environment in which individual software agents,
    emulate drummers improvising within a percussion ensemble. Player agents assume
    roles and personalities within the ensemble, and communicate with one another
    to create complex rhythmic interactions. In this project, the ensemble is comprised
    of a 12-armed musical robot, MahaDeviBot, in which each limb has its own software
    agent controlling what it performs. '

    by means of an elementary gesture sonification. This work takes inspiration from
    Bauhaus'' ideals and Paul Klee''s investigation into forms and pictorial representation.
    In line with these ideas, the main aim of this work is to reduce gesture to a
    combination of a small number of elementary components (gestalts) used to control
    a corresponding small set of sounds. By means of a demonstrative tool, we introduce
    here a line of research that is at its initial stage. The envisaged goal of future

  abstract: 'Moving out of doors with digital tools and electronic music and creating
    musically rich experiences is made possible by the increased availability of ever
    smaller and more powerful mobile computers. Composing music for and in a landscape
    instead of for a closed architectural space offers new perspectives but also raises
    questions about interaction and composition of electronic music. The work we present
    here was commissioned by a festival and ran on a daily basis over a period of
    three months. A GPS-enabled embedded Linux system is assembled to serve as a location-aware
    sound platform. Several challenges have to be overcome both technically and artistically
    to achieve a seamless experience and provide a simple device to be handed to the
    public. By building this interactive experience, which relies as much on the user''s
    willingness to explore the invisible sonic landscape as on the ability to deploy
    the technology, a number of new avenues for exploring electronic music and interactivity
    in location-based media open up. New ways of composing music for and in a landscape
    and for creating audience interaction are explored. '

  abstract: 'Sound libraries for music synthesizers easily comprise one thousand or
    more programs (''''patches''''). Thus, there are enough raw data to apply data
    mining to reveal typical settings and to extract dependencies. Intelligent user
    interfaces for music synthesizers can be based on such statistics. This paper
    proposes two approaches: First, the user sets any number of parameters and then
    lets the system find the nearest sounds in the database, a kind of patch autocompletion.
    Second, all parameters are "live" as usual, but turning one knob or setting a
    switch will also change the settings of other, statistically related controls.
    Both approaches canbe used with the standard interface of the synthesizer. On
    top of that, this paper introduces alternative or additional interfaces based

    (PANs) have precipitated the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for low-power, low-cost wireless
    sensor networks. We have applied this new technology to create a fully wireless,

    Various motion analysis and machine learning techniques are applied to the raw

  abstract: 'This research aims to develop a wearable musical interface which enables
    to control audio and video signals by using hand gestures and human body motions.
    We have been developing an audio-visual manipulation system that realizes tracks
    control, time-based operations and searching for tracks from massive music library.
    It aims to build an emotional and affecting musical interaction, and will provide
    a better method of music listening to people. A sophisticated glove-like device
    with an acceleration sensor and several strain sensors has been developed. A realtime
    signal processing and musical control are executed as a result of gesture recognition.
    We also developed a stand-alone device that performs as a musical controller and
    player at the same time. In this paper, we describe the development of a compact
    and sophisticated sensor device, and demonstrate its performance of audio and
    video signals control.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe the development of multi-platform tools for
    Audiovisual and Kinetic installations. These involve the connection of three development
    environments: Python, SuperCollider and Processing, in order to drive kinetic
    art installations and to combine these with digital synthesis of sound and image
    in real time. By connecting these three platforms via the OSC protocol, we enable
    the control in real time of analog physical media (a device that draws figures
    on sand), sound synthesis and image synthesis. We worked on the development of
    algorithms for drawing figures and synthesizing images and sound on all three
    platforms and experimented with various mechanisms for coordinating synthesis
    and rendering in different media. Several problems were addressed: How to coordinate
    the timing between different platforms? What configuration to use? Clientserver
    (who is the client who the server?), equal partners, mixed configurations. A library
    was developed in SuperCollider to enable the packaging of algorithms into modules
    with automatic generation of GUI from specifications, and the saving of configurations
    of modules into session files as scripts in SuperCollider code. The application
    of this library as a framework for both driving graphic synthesis in Processing
    and receiving control data from it resulted in an environment for experimentation
    that is also being used successfully in teaching interactive audiovisual media. '

  abstract: 'In this paper, we present a pitch space based musical interface approach.
    A pitch space arranges tones in a way that meaningful tone combinations can be
    easily generated. Using a touch sensitive surface or a 3D-Joystick a player can
    move through the pitch space and create the desired sound by selecting tones.
    The more optimal the tones are geometrically arranged, the less control parameters
    are required to move through the space and to select the desired pitches. For
    this the quality of pitch space based musical interfaces depends on two factors:
    1. the way how the tones are organized within the pitch space and 2. the way how
    the parameters of a given controller are used to move through the space and to
    select pitches. This paper presents a musical interface based on a tonal pitch
    space derived from a four dimensional model found by the music psychologists [11],
    [2]. The proposed pitch space particularly eases the creation of tonal harmonic
    music. Simultaneously it outlines music psychological and theoretical principles

    of the fingers and hand is commonly accepted as 1 kHz. However, during the course
    of our research to develop a full-hand vibrotactile musical communication device
    for the hearing-impaired, we repeatedly found evidence suggesting sensitivity
    to higher frequencies. Most of the studies on which vibrotactile sensitivity are
    based have been conducted using sine tones delivered by point-contact actuators.
    The current study was designed to investigate vibrotactile sensitivity using complex
    signals and full, open-hand contact with a flat vibrating surface representing
    more natural environmental conditions. Sensitivity to frequencies considerably
    higher than previously reported was demonstrated for all the signal types tested.
    Furthermore, complex signals seem to be more easily detected than sine tones,
    especially at low frequencies. Our findings are applicable to a general understanding
    of sensory physiology, and to the development of new vibrotactile display devices
    for music and other applications.'

  abstract: 'This paper presents the results of user interaction with two explorative
    music environments (sound system A and B) that were inspired from the Banda Linda
    music tradition in two different ways. The sound systems adapted to how a team
    of two players improvised and made a melody together in an interleaved fashion:
    Systems A and B used a fuzzy logic algorithm and pattern recognition to respond
    with modifications of a background rhythms. In an experiment with a pen tablet
    interface as the music instrument, users aged 10-13 were to tap tones and continue
    each other''s melody. The sound systems rewarded users sonically, if they managed
    to add tones to their mutual melody in a rapid turn taking manner with rhythmical
    patterns. Videos of experiment sessions show that user teams contributed to a
    melody in ways that resemble conversation. Interaction data show that each sound
    system made player teams play in different ways, but players in general had a
    hard time adjusting to a non-Western music tradition. The paper concludes with
    a comparison and evaluation of the two sound systems. Finally it proposes a new
    approach to the design of collaborative and shared music environments that is
    based on ''''listening applications''''.'

  abstract: 'This paper contends that the development of expressive performance interfaces
    using multi-touch technology has been hindered by an over-reliance upon GUI paradigms.
    Despite offering rich and robust data output and multiple ways to interpret it,
    approaches towards using multi-touch technology in digit al musical inst rument
    design have been markedly conservative, showing a strong tendency towards modeling
    existing hardware. This not only negates many of the benefits of multi-touch technology
    but also creates specific difficulties in the context of live music performance.
    A case study of two other interface types that have seen considerable musical
    use --the XY pad and button grid --illustrates the manner in which the implicit
    characteristics of a device determine the conditions under which it will favorably
    perform. Accordingly, this paper proposes an alternative approach to multi-touch
    which emp hasizes the imp licit strengths of the technology and establishes a
    philosophy of design around them. Finally, we introduce two toolkits currently
    being used to assess the validity of this approach.'

  abstract: "Performing music with a computer and loudspeakers represents always a\
    \ challenge. The lack of a traditional instrument requires the performer to study\
    \ idiomatic strategies by which musicianship becomes apparent. On the other hand,\
    \ the audience needs to decode those strategies, so to achieve an understanding\
    \ and appreciation of the music being played. The issue is particularly relevant\
    \ to the performance of music that results from the mediation between biological\
    \ signals of the human body and physical performance.\nThe present article tackles\
    \ this concern by demonstrating a new model of musical performance; what I define\
    \ biophysical music. This is music generated and played in real time by amplifying\
    \ and processing the acoustic sound of a performer's muscle contractions. The\
    \ model relies on an original and open source technology made of custom biosensors\
    \ and a related software framework. The succesfull application of these tools\
    \ is discussed in the practical context of a solo piece for sensors, laptop and\
    \ loudspeakers. Eventually, the compositional strategies that characterize the\
    \ piece are discussed along with a systematic description of the relevant mapping\
    \ techniques and their sonic outcome."

    Instrument (DMI) evaluation methodology, which provides structured tools for the
    incremental development of prototypes based on user feedback. This paper emphasizes
    an important but often ignored stakeholder present in the context of musical performance:

  abstract: 'In site-specific installation or situated media, a significant part of
    the "I" in NIME is the environment, the site and the implicit features of site
    such as humans, weather, materials, natural acoustics, etc. These could be viewed
    as design constraints, or features, even agency determining the outcome of responsive
    sound installation works. This paper discusses the notion of interface in public
    (especially outdoor) installation, starting with the authors'' Sculpture by the
    Sea Windtraces work using this recent experience as the launch-pad, with reference
    to ways in which others have approached it (focusing on sensor, weather-activated
    outdoor installations in a brief traverse of related cases, e.g. works by Garth
    Paine, James Bulley and Daniel Jones, and David Bowen). This is a dialogical paper
    on the topic of interface and `site'' as the aetiology of interaction/interface/instrument
    and its type of response (e.g. to environment and audience). While the focus here
    is on outdoor factors (particularly the climatic environment), indoor site-specific
    installation also experiences the effects of ambient noise, acoustic context,
    and audience as integral agents in the interface and perception of the work, its
    musical expression. The way in which features of the situation are integrated
    has relevance for others in the NIME community in the design of responsive spaces,
    art installation, and large-scale or installed instruments in which users, participants,
    acoustics play a significant role.'

  abstract: 'The augmented ballet project aims at gathering research from several
    fields and directing them towards a same application case: adding virtual elements
    (visual and acoustic) to a dance live performance, and allowing the dancer to
    interact with them. In this paper, we describe a novel interaction that we used
    in the frame of this project: using the dancer''s movements to recognize the emotions
    he expresses, and use these emotions to generate musical audio flows evolving
    in real-time. The originality of this interaction is threefold. First, it covers
    the whole interaction cycle from the input (the dancer''s movements) to the output
    (the generated music). Second, this interaction isn''t direct but goes through
    a high level of abstraction: dancer''s emotional expression is recognized and
    is the source of music generation. Third, this interaction has been designed and
    validated through constant collaboration with a choreographer, culminating in
    an augmented ballet performance in front of a live audience.'

  abstract: 'Development of new musical interfaces often requires experimentation
    with the mapping of available controller inputs to output parameters. Useful mappings
    for a particular application may be complex in nature, with one or more inputs
    being linked to one or more outputs. Existing development environments are commonly
    used to program such mappings, while code libraries provide powerful data-stream
    manipulation. However, room exists for a standalone application with a simpler
    graphical user interface for dynamically patching between inputs and outputs.
    This paper presents an early prototype version of a software tool that allows
    the user to route control signals in real time, using various messaging formats.
    It is cross-platform and runs as a standalone application in desktop and Android
    OS versions. The latter allows the users of mobile devices to experiment with
    mapping signals to and from physical computing components using the inbuilt multi-touch

    units such as live loopers, reverbs, distortion pedals, etc. The goal was to to
    provide dramatically increased expressive control to vocal performances, and address
    some of the shortcomings of pedal-controlled effects. The addition of gestural
    controls from the motion sensors opens up new performance possibilities such as
    panning the voice simply by pointing the microphone in one direction or another.

  abstract: 'We augment the piano keyboard with a 3D gesture space using Microsoft
    Kinect for sensing and top-down projection for visual feedback. This interface
    provides multi-axial gesture controls to enable continuous adjustments to multiple
    acoustic parameters such as those on the typical digital synthesizers. We believe
    that using gesture control is more visceral and aesthetically pleasing, especially
    during concert performance where the visibility of the performer''s action is
    important. Our system can also be used for other types of gesture interaction
    as well as for pedagogical applications.'

    consumption. Communica-tion with the board is based on the ZigFlea protocol and
    it has been evaluated on a CUI32 using the StickOS oper-ating system. Experiments
    show that the total sensor data collection time is linearly increasing with the
    number of sensor samples used. A data rate of 0.8 kbit/s is achieved for wirelessly
    transmitting three axes of a 3D accelerometer. Although this data rate is low
    compared to other systems, our solution benefits from ease-of-use and stability,

    analysis of Gyil performance, live improvised electro-acoustic music incorporating
    the Gyil, and hybrid sampling and physical mod-eling. In all three of these cases,
    detailed information about what is played on the Gyil needs to be digitally captured

    this. It is based on contact microphones and is informed by the specific characteristics
    of the Gyil. An alternative approach based on indirect acquisition is to apply
    polyphonic transcription on the signal acquired by a microphone without requiring
    the instrument to be modified. The direct sensing apparatus we have developed
    can be used to acquire ground truth for evaluating different approaches to polyphonic
    transcription and help create a ``surrogate'''' sensor. Some initial results comparing
    different strategies to polyphonic transcription are presented.'

    capacitive sensing to detect proximity of the player''s body to the metal object,
    and sound is generated through a surface transducer which can be attached to any
    flat surface. Because the capacitive sensor can be any shape or size, absolute
    capacitive thresholding is not possible since the baseline capacitance will change.
    Instead, we use a differential-based moving sum threshold which can rapidly adjust
    to changes in the environment or be re-calibrated to a new metal object. We show
    that this dynamic threshold is effective in rejecting environmental noise and
    rapidly adapting to new objects. We also present details for constructing Instant

    fixed on a violin and an acceleration sensor placed on the bow. Sensor measurements
    were obtained at a high sampling rate, gathering the data with a small mi-crocontroller
    unit, connected with a laptop computer. To capture bow''s position, rotation and
    angle directly on the bow to string contact point, the micro camcorder was fixed
    near the bridge. Main focuses of interest were the changes of the left hand finger,
    the temporal synchronization between left hand fingers with the right hand, the
    close up view to the bow to string contact point and the contact of the left hand
    finger and/or string to the fingerboard. Seven violinists, from beginners to master
    class students played scales in different rhythms, speeds and bowings and music
    excerpts of free choice while being recorded. One measure-ment with 2 violinists

    Our current research is exploring ways of improving the quality of interaction

    The motivation behind this work is the need for easy access tools to explore,
    compose and perform electroacoustic music in Colombian music schools and conservatories.
    This work led to the adaptation of common hardware to be used as a sensor attached
    to an acoustic instrument and the development of software applications to record,
    visualize and map performers gesture data into signal processing parameters. The
    scope of this work suggested that focus was to be made on a specific instrument
    so the saxophone was chosen. Gestures were selected in an iterative process with
    the performer, although a more ambitious strategy to figure out main gestures
    of an instruments performance was first defined. Detailed gesture-to-sound processing
    mappings are exposed in the text. An electroacoustic musical piece was successfully

  abstract: 'This paper presents the author''s derivations system, an interactive
    performance system for solo improvising instrumentalist. The system makes use
    of a combination of real-time audio analysis, live sampling and spectral re-synthesis
    to build a vocabulary of possible performative responses to live instrumental
    input throughout an improvisatory performance. A form of timbral matching is employed
    to form a link between the live performer and an expanding database of musical
    materials. In addition, the system takes into account the unique nature of the
    rehearsal/practice space in musical performance through the implementation of
    performer-configurable cumulative rehearsal databases into the final design. This

  abstract: 'Hyper-instruments extend traditional acoustic instruments with sensing
    technologies that capture digitally subtle and sophisticated aspects of human
    performance. They leverage the long training and skills of performers while simultaneously
    providing rich possibilities for digital control. Many existing hyper-instruments
    suffer from being one of a kind instruments that require invasive modifications
    to the underlying acoustic instrument. In this paper we focus on the pitched percussion
    family and describe a non-invasive sensing approach for extending them to hyper-instruments.
    Our primary concern is to retain the technical integrity of the acoustic instrument
    and sound production methods while being able to intuitively interface the computer.
    This is accomplished by utilizing the Kinect sensor to track the position of the
    mallets without any modification to the instrument which enables easy and cheap
    replication of the pro-posed hyper-instrument extensions. In addition we describe
    two approaches to higher-level gesture control that remove the need for additional
    control devices such as foot pedals and fader boxes that are frequently used in
    electro-acoustic performance. This gesture control integrates more organically
    with the natural flow of playing the instrument providing user selectable control
    over filter parameters, synthesis, sampling, sequencing, and improvisation using
    a commer-cially available low-cost sensing apparatus.'

  abstract: 'Designing mobile interfaces for computer-based musical performance is
    generally a time-consuming task that can be exasperating for performers. Instead
    of being able to experiment freely with physical interfaces'' affordances, performers
    must spend time and attention on non-musical tasks including network configuration,
    development environments for the mobile devices, defining OSC address spaces,
    and handling the receipt of OSC in the environment that will control and produce

    to both generate and read the output of interfaces on mobile devices. For iOS

    a simple set of OSC messages to define interfaces and automatically route output.
    On the desktop, our implementations in Max/MSP/Jitter, LuaAV, and Su-perCollider
    allow users to create mobile widgets mapped to sonic parameters with a single

  abstract: 'This paper provides an overview of a new method for approaching beat
    sequencing. As we have come to know them drum machines provide means to loop rhythmic
    patterns over a certain interval. Usually with the option to specify different
    beat divisions. What I developed and propose for consideration is a rethinking
    of the traditional drum machine confines. The Sinkapater is an untethered beat
    sequencer in that the beat division, and the loop length can be arbitrarily modified
    for each track. The result is the capability to create complex syncopated patterns
    which evolve over time as different tracks follow their own loop rate. To keep
    cohesion all channels can be locked to a master channel forcing a loop to be an
    integer number of "Master Beats". Further a visualization mode enables exploring
    the patterns in another new way. Using synchronized OpenGL a 3-Dimensional environment
    visualizes the beats as droplets falling from faucets of varying heights determined
    by the loop length. Waves form in the bottom as beats splash into the virtual
    "sink". By combining compelling visuals and a new approach to sequencing a new
    way of exploring beats and experiencing music has been created.'

  abstract: 'Mapping between musical interfaces, and sound engines, is integral to
    the nature of an interface [3]. Traditionally, musical applications for touch
    surfaces have directly mapped touch coordinates to control parameters. However,
    recent work [9] is looking at new methods of control that use relational multi-point
    analysis. Instead of directly using touch coordinates, which are related to a
    global screen space, an initial touch is used as an `anchor'' to create a local
    coordinate space in which subsequent touches can be located and compared. This
    local coordinate space frees touches from being locked to one single relationship,
    and allows for more complex interaction between touch events. So far, this method
    has only been implemented on Apple computer''s small capacitive touch pads. Additionally,
    there has yet to be a user study that directly compares [9] against mappings of
    touch events within global coordinate spaces. With this in mind, we have developed
    and evaluated two interfaces with the aim of determining and quantifying some
    of these differences within the context of our custom large multi-touch surfaces

    sounds resonating within its wooden body and ma-nipulates them via gestural movements.
    The sounds are transduced by a piezoelectric sensor inside the wooden body, so
    any tactile contact with TedStick is transmitted as audio and further processed
    by a computer. The main method for performing with TedStick focuses on extracting
    diverse sounds from within the resonant properties of TedStick it-self. This is
    done by holding TedStick in one hand and a standard drumstick in the opposite
    hand while tapping, rubbing, or scraping the two against each other. Gestural
    movements of TedStick are then mapped to parameters for several sound effects
    including pitch shift, delay, reverb and low/high pass filters. Using this technique
    the hand holding the drumstick can control the acoustic sounds/interaction between

    pleasure, which enables to extract player''s movement, understand player''s activities,
    and generate them to sounds. We have designed a karate training environment which
    consists of a multimodal room with cameras, microphones, video displays and loud
    speakers, and wearable devices with a sensor and a sound generator. Experiments
    have been conducted on ten Karate beginnners for ten months to examine the effectiveness
    to learn appropriate body action and sharpness in basic punch called TSUKI. The
    experimental results suggest the proposed sound feedback and the training environments
    enable beginners to achieve enjoyable Karate.'

    In thispaper we are focussing on the issue of Dynamic Patching,which is a particular

    Unlike commonvisual programming languages for sound synthesis, whichconceptually
    separate the patch building process from theactual musical performance, the reacTable*
    combines theconstruction and playing of the instrument in a unique way.The tangible

  abstract: We have seen many new and exciting developments in new interfaces for
    musical expression. In this paper we present the design of an interface for remote
    group music improvisation and composition - Daisyphone. The approach relies on
    players creating and editing short shared loops of music which are semi-synchronously
    updated. The interface emphasizes the looping nature of the music and is designed
    to be engaging and deployable on a wide range of interaction devices. Observations
    of the use of the tool with different levels of persistence of contribution are
    reported and discussed. Future developments centre around ways to string loops
    together into larger pieces (composition) and investigating suitable rates of
    decay to encourage more group improvisation.

  abstract: 'The authors have developed several methods for spatially distributing
    spectral material in real-time using frequency-domain processing. Applying spectral
    spatialization techniques to more than two channels introduces a few obstacles,
    particularly with controllers, visualization and the manipulation of large amounts
    of control data. Various interfaces are presented which address these issues.
    We also discuss 3D “cube” controllers and visualizations, which go a long way
    in aiding usability. A range of implementations were realized, each with its own
    interface, automation, and output characteristics. We also explore a number of
    novel techniques. For example, a sound’s spectral components can be mapped in
    space based on its own components’ energy, or the energy of another signal’s components
    (a kind of spatial cross-synthesis). Finally, we address aesthetic concerns, such
    as perceptual and sonic coherency, which arise when sounds have been spectrally
    dissected and scattered across a multi-channel spatial field in 64, 128 or more
    spectral bands.'

  abstract: 'On-the-fly programming is a style of programming in which the programmer/performer/composer
    augments and modifies the program while it is running, without stopping or restarting,
    in order to assert expressive, programmable control at runtime. Because of the
    fundamental powers of programming languages, we believe the technical and aesthetic
    aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring. In this paper, we present
    a formalized framework for on-the-fly programming, based on the ChucK synthesis
    language, which supports a truly concurrent audio programming model with sample-synchronous
    timing, and a highly on-the-fly style of programming. We first provide a well-defined
    notion of on-thefly programming. We then address four fundamental issues that
    confront the on-the-fly programmer: timing, modularity, conciseness, and flexibility.
    Using the features and properties of ChucK, we show how it solves many of these
    issues. In this new model, we show that (1) concurrency provides natural modularity
    for on-the-fly programming, (2) the timing mechanism in ChucK guarantees on-the-fly
    precision and consistency, (3) the Chuck syntax improves conciseness, and (4)
    the overall system is a useful framework for exploring on-the-fly programming.
    Finally, we discuss the aesthetics of on-the-fly performance. '

  abstract: 'In this paper, I would like to introduce my experimental study of multimedia
    psychology. My initial focus of investigation is the interaction between perceptions
    of auditory and visual beats. When the musical and graphical beats are completely
    synchronized with each other, as in a music video for promotional purposes, the
    audience feels that they are natural and comforting. My initial experiment has
    proved that the actual tempos of music and images are a little different. If a
    slight timelag exists between the musical and pictorial beats, the audience tries
    to keep them in synchronization by unconsciously changing the interpretation of
    the time-based beat points. As the lag increases over time, the audience seems
    to perceive that the beat synchronization has changed from being more downbeat
    to more upbeat, and continues enjoying it. I have developed an experiment system
    that can generateand control out-of-phase visual and auditory beats in real time,
    and have tested many subjects with it. This paper describes the measurement of
    time lags generated in the experiment system, as part of my psychological experiment.'

  abstract: 'In this paper, we describe a novel improvisation supporting system based
    on correcting musically unnatural melodies. Since improvisation is the musical
    performance style that involves creating melodies while playing, it is not easy
    even for the people who can play musical instruments. However, previous studies
    have not dealt with improvisation support for the people who can play musical
    instruments but cannot improvise. In this study, to support such players'' improvisation,
    we propose a novel improvisation supporting system called ism, which corrects
    musically unnatural melodies automatically. The main issue in realizing this system
    is how to detect notes to be corrected (i.e., musically unnatural or inappropriate).
    We propose a method for detecting notes to be corrected based on the N-gram model.
    This method first calculates N-gram probabilities of played notes, and then judges
    notes with low N-gram probabilities to be corrected. Experimental results show
    that the N-gram-based melody correction and the proposed system are useful for
    supporting improvisation.'

  abstract: 'High capacity of transmission lines (Ethernet in particular) is much
    higher than what imposed by MIDI today. So it is possible to use capturing interfaces
    with high-speed and high-resolution, thanks to the OSC protocol, for musical synthesis
    (either in realtime or non real-time). These new interfaces offer many advantages,
    not only in the area of musical composition with use of sensors but also in live
    and interactive performances. In this manner, the processes of calibration and
    signal processing are delocalized on a personal computer and augments possibilities
    of processing. In this demo, we present two hardware interfaces developed in La
    kitchen with corresponding processing to achieve a high-resolution, high-speed
    sensor processing for musical applications. '

    synthesizes musical sounds and graphical images on the floor from people''s act
    of "walking". The aim of this paper is to develop such a system that enables nonprofessional
    people in our public spaces to play good contrapuntal music without any knowledge
    of music theory. The people are just walking. This system is based on the i-trace
    system [1] which can capture the people''s behavior and give some visual feedback. '
