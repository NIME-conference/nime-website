# Ethical guidelines for NIME publications

The publication of a paper in the **Proceedings of the international conference on new interfaces for musical expression** is an essential building block in the development of a coherent and respected network of knowledge. It is a direct reflection of the quality of the work of the authors and the institutions that support them. Peer-reviewed papers support and embody academic research methods. It is therefore important to agree upon standards of expected ethical behavior for all parties involved in the act of publishing: the authors, the editors, the peer reviewers, the publisher and the society.

## Duties of authors

### Reporting standards

Authors of papers of original research should present an accurate account of the work performed as well as an objective discussion of its significance. Underlying data should be represented accurately in the paper. A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to permit others to validate and/or replicate the work.

Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behavior and are unacceptable.

Review and professional publication papers should also be accurate and objective, and editorial opinion works should be clearly identified as such.

### Data access and retention

Authors are encouraged to - and may be asked to - provide the raw data in connection with a paper for editorial review, and should be prepared to provide public access to such data, if practicable, and should in any event be prepared to retain such data for a reasonable time after publication.

### Originality and plagiarism

The authors should ensure that they have written entirely original works, and if the authors have used the work and/or words of others that this has been appropriately cited or quoted. Plagiarism takes many forms, from passing of another paper as the authors own paper, to copying or paraphrasing substantial parts of another paper (without attribution), to claiming results from research conducted by others. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.

### Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication

An author should not in general publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one publication. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal or conference proceedings concurrently constitutes unethical publishing behavior and is unacceptable.

### Acknowledgement of sources

Proper acknowledgment of the work of others must always be given. Authors should cite publications that have been influential in determining the nature of the reported work. Information obtained privately, as in conversation, correspondence, or discussion with third parties, must not be used or reported without explicit, written permission from the source. Information obtained in the course of confidential services, such as refereeing manuscripts or grant applications, must not be used without the explicit written permission of the author of the work involved in these services.

### Authorship of the paper

Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Where there are others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project, they should be acknowledged or listed as contributors. The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors and no inappropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication (this practice is often referred to as the [Vancouver guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html#two)).

### Disclosure and conflicts of interest

All authors should disclose in their manuscript any financial or other substantive conflict of interest that might be construed to influence the results or interpretation of their manuscript. All sources of financial support for the project should be disclosed. Examples of potential conflicts of interest which should be disclosed include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Potential conflicts of interest should be disclosed at the earliest stage possible.

### Fundamental errors in published works

When an author discovers a significant error or inaccuracy in his/her own published work, it is the authors’ obligation to promptly notify the main editor or publisher and cooperate with the main editor to retract or correct the paper. If the editor or the publisher learns from a third party that a published work contains a significant error, it is the obligation of the author to promptly retract or correct the paper or provide evidence to the main editor of the correctness of the original paper.

## Duties of the Paper Chair(s) and Reviewers

### Publication decisions

The paper chair(s) of each year's NIME conference is responsible for deciding which of the papers submitted to the conference proceedings should be published. The validation of the work in question and its importance to researchers and readers must always drive such decisions. The main editor may be guided by legal requirements as shall then be in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism. The main editor may confer with others in making this decision.

### Fair play

The paper chair(s) should evaluate manuscripts for their intellectual content without regard to race, gender, sexual orientation, religious belief, ethnic origin, citizenship, or political philosophy of the authors. See also the [NIME Conference Diversity Statement](http://www.nime.org/diversity/).

### Confidentiality

The paper chair(s) must not disclose any information about a submitted manuscript to anyone other than the corresponding author, reviewers, and potential reviewers, as appropriate.

### Disclosure and conflicts of interest

Unpublished materials disclosed in a submitted manuscript must not be used in a chair's/reviewer's own research without the express written consent of the author. Privileged information or ideas obtained through peer review must be kept confidential and not used for personal advantage. Reviewers should recuse themselves from considering manuscripts in which they have conflicts of interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other relationships or connections with any of the authors, companies, or (possibly) institutions connected to the papers. Reviewers should require all contributors to disclose relevant competing interests and publish corrections if competing interests are revealed after publication. If needed, other appropriate action should be taken, such as the publication of a retraction or expression of concern.

### Involvement and cooperation in investigations

The paper chair(s) should take reasonably responsive measures when ethical complaints have been presented concerning a submitted manuscript or published paper. Such measures will generally include contacting the author of the manuscript or paper and giving due consideration of the respective complaint or claims made, but may also include further communications to the relevant institutions and research bodies, and if the complaint is upheld, the publication of a correction, retraction, expression of concern, or other note, as may be relevant. Every reported act of unethical publishing behavior must be looked into, even if it is discovered years after publication.

These guidelines were made by the NIME Steering Committee and are based on principles the COPE [Code of Conduct and Best Practice Guidelines for Journal Editors](http://publicationethics.org/files/Code%20of%20Conduct_2.pdf) and the [Code of Conduct for Journal Publishers](http://publicationethics.org/files/Code%20of%20conduct%20for%20publishers%20FINAL_1_0_0.pdf).
