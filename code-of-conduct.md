### Short version

NIME is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free community and conference experience for everyone. Our code of conduct can be found at: [http://www.nime.org/code-of-conduct](http://www.nime.org/code-of-conduct).

### Long version

NIME is dedicated to providing an inclusive, harassment-free community and conference experience for everyone regardless of all ethnicities, countries of origin, gender identities and expressions, ages, abilities, religions, sexual orientations, physical appearances, body sizes, economic backgrounds, scholarly or professional backgrounds, employment, religions, and other differences.

We do not tolerate any form of harassment, whether in person or online, at NIME conferences or any other community events or platforms such as meetings or online forums. Harassment is unwelcome conduct that reinforces social structures of domination. This conduct encompasses a broad range of behaviors, and might take the form of verbal commentary (directly to, or about others), bullying, deliberate intimidation, offensive language or media, sexually suggestive images, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, impersonating someone else, presenting someone elseâ€™s work as one's own, sharing confidential or sensitive information without consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention. Apologize for mistakes when your behavior is highlighted as being disrespectful, and consider how you might choose different actions or words in the future.

By registering for and attending the NIME conference, whether in person or online, and by using the NIME forum you agree to abide  by this code of conduct at all conference venues, conference-related social events, and all private or public discussions in the forum. The policy extends equally to exhibitors, vendors, sponsors, and other attendees. Individuals must always be recognizable, especially online, by selecting usernames that reflect their true identity. Organizers, moderators, and administrators have the right to ask individuals to change their names. Individuals violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund, and banned from the forum.

The principles and the code of practice regarding ethical research that have been adopted by NIME can be found at: [https://nime.org/ethics/](https://nime.org/ethics/).

#### Reporting and Consequences

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns related to breaches of the NIME code of conduct, do not hesitate to report the misconduct.  Reports are treated confidentially.

At NIME conferences, whether you are attending in person or online, reports of harassment should be directed to a general chair. The name and email address of the general chair(s) can be found on the NIME conference homepage.

If needed, conference staff will also be happy to assist participants in contacting venue security or local law enforcement, providing escorts, or otherwise ensuring the safety of those experiencing harassment for the duration of the conference.

The general chair and co-chairs will examine the case and may seek further input from other members of the NIME board. If necessary, they will audit the individuals involved and determine whether the offending party should receive a warning or be expelled from the conference without reimbursement. Additionally, there is the option to report the incident to the authorities.

Regarding issues on the NIME forum, please reach out to the administrators at [forum@nime.org](mailto:forum@nime.org). Upon receiving your message, administrators along with board members will review the case, audit the parties involved if required, and make decisions about the removal of posts or other content. They will also determine whether accounts should be disabled temporarily or permanently, and consider bans on individuals for future use of the forum.

We value your attendance and participation in the community.
