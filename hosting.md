If you are interested in hosting a future NIME in your city, please submit a proposal to the [Steering Committee](http://www.nime.org/?page_id=89). Proposal forms are available below. NIME has a tradition of moving the conference between North America, Asia and Europe thus far. Nevertheless, the excellence of the proposal is the most important factor for the decision taken by the Steering Committee.

Please send your NIME hosting application (for 2022 and later) by **15 July 2020** to [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](http://www.hf.uio.no/imv/english/people/aca/alexanje/index.html), chair of the [steering committee](http://www.nime.org/committee/). Feel free to approach us with any questions you may have regarding hosting the conference.
