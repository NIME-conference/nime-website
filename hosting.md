The Steering Committee is looking for hosts for NIME 2022 and later. Previous conferences have usually been hosted by one institution (or a few geographically close ones). NIME 2020 was fully online, 2021 is planned as hybrid (physical+online). The Steering Committee is interested in exploring hub-based conference formats in 2022 and onwards. There are many ways this could be done. One solution could be to have a central conference hub with satellite venues around the world. Another option could be to have a more distributed organization across multiple locations. Whatever format, we would need to think differently about the organization. We are particularly encouraging collaboration between individuals and/or institutions around the world.

If you are interested in hosting NIME, please get in touch with the Steering Committee (steering(Ã¦)nime.org) or the [Chair](https://people.uio.no/alexanje) to discuss more. You can also take a look at the [NIME Conference Cookbok](https://nime.gitbook.io/conference-cookbok/) with information about how the conferences is run.

### Deadline

Please get in touch as soon as possible to discuss your ideas with the Steering Committee. Deadline for submitting a formal proposal: **15 May 2021**.
