The Steering Committee is looking for hosts for NIME 2022 and later. Previous conferences have usually been hosted by one institution (or a few geographically close ones). NIME 2020 was fully online, 2021 is planned as hybrid (physical+online). The Steering Committee is particularly interested in exploring a hub-based conference format in 2022.

To succeed with a hub-based conference format, we would need to think differently about the organization. We are particularly encouraging collaboration between individuals and/or institutions around the world.

If you are interested in hosting NIME, please get in touch with [Alexander Refsum Jensenius](http://www.hf.uio.no/imv/english/people/aca/alexanje/index.html), chair of the [Steering Committee](http://www.nime.org/committee/).

Deadline for hosting applications: **15 January 2021**
