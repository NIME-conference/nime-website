The Steering Committee is looking for hosts for NIME 2022 and later. Previous conferences have usually been hosted by one institution (or a few geographically close ones). NIME 2020 was fully online, 2021 is planned as hybrid (physical+online). The Steering Committee is particularly interested in exploring hub-based conference formats in 2022.

To succeed with a hub-based conference format, we would need to think differently about the organization. We are particularly encouraging collaboration between individuals and/or institutions around the world.

If you are interested in hosting NIME, please get in touch with the Steering Committee (steering(Ã¦)nime.org) or the [Chair](https://people.uio.no/alexanje).

### Deadline

Please get in touch as soon as possible to discus your ideas with the Steering Committee. Deadline for submitting a formal proposal: **15 May 2021**.
