### NIME

The International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) gathers researchers and musicians from all over the world to share their knowledge and late-breaking work on new musical interface design. The conference started out as a workshop at the [Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems](https://www.acm.org/sigchi/) (CHI) in 2001. Since then, an annual series of international conferences have been held around the world, hosted by research groups dedicated to interface design, human-computer interaction, and computer music.

This website is the permanent repository for [NIME proceedings](/papers/), serving as a historical record of past NIME conferences, a hub for sharing ongoing initiatives and governance within the NIME community, and a reference for planning documents and policies for future NIMEs.
