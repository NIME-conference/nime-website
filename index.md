### Upcoming Conference

[**NIME2024**](http://www.nime2024.org/) will be held in a hybrid mode in Utrecht (NL) and online 4-6 September 2024.

### NIME

The International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression gathers researchers and musicians from all over the world to share their knowledge and late-breaking work on new musical interface design. The conference started out as a workshop at the [Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems](https://www.acm.org/sigchi/) (CHI) in 2001. Since then, an annual series of international conferences have been held around the world, hosted by research groups dedicated to interface design, human-computer interaction, and computer music.
