The NIME community runs the mailing list [community@nime.org](mailto:community@nime.org),  which is used for posting useful information about the world of new instrument design. The mailing list is moderated, and fairly low-traffic (less than one e-mail per day).

Posts to the list should be restricted to calls for papers/works, job announcements, and topics of specific interest to the NIME community.

Except where specifically relevant to a large proportion of the NIME community, posts regarding products, software and concert performances should not be posted.

In order to subscribe to the list, please send an email to [nime-community+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:nime-community+subscribe@googlegroups.com). To unsubscribe from the list, send an email to [mailto:nime-community+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:nime-community+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com).

### Mailing List Archive

The mailing list is hosted on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nime-community), which provides a searchable archive of discussions.
