The objective of the NIME mentorship program is to increase the inclusiveness of our community by helping NIME newcomers, especially underrepresented groups and non-English speakers, to be onboarded in the NIME discourse.  The goal of the mentorship program to bring newcomer to the NIME community and match them with experts in the field. A mentor is expected to help a newcomer (mentee) position their work within the NIME discourse, and the mentorship would ideally result in a co-authored NIME submission.

The mentorship program and application platforms are open throughout the year. The mentee applies with a proposed project they want to work on and need some form of mentorship. According to the proposed project, the program runs ideally between three months to a year. Once the mentee submissions are complete, the mentors’ availability is checked, and the mentees are matched with their mentors. The committee assigns a mentor to each proposed project based on the mentor's availability and expertise. The program operates on a first-come, first-served basis. If no mentor for the proposed project can be found, the proposed project is saved for a year until a mentor is found. If no mentor is found within that time, the mentee candidate must submit either the same project again or a new one.

### Who can be a mentee?
There are two main categories of mentees:

* Master students or early-stage PhD Students without a supervisor who is part of the NIME/music technology debate. 
* Anyone who has not published at NIME before and is without a supervisor who is part of the NIME/music technology debate.

As a mentee, you must apply with a project. The goal is to connect researchers who are working in the same field so that they can learn from each other. If you need a mentor and do not fit into these categories, please send us an [email](mailto:kergen1@lsu.edu), and we will be happy to discuss your application. People from underrepresented groups will have priority.
