### Pamela Z Award for Innovation

This award recognizes a person who is doing significant work that improves the discussion about diversity in NIME - either through their research, connecting people or through actions such as organisation and awareness. It was named after Pamela Z because she was a keynote in the founding year, because she is a pioneer in this field and an extraordinary artist, and because spending time each NIME thinking about an award named after a prolific African American woman is a way of continually highlighting the value of her work, and representing voices that are often invisible in the community.
