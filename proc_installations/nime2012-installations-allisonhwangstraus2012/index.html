				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Social Structure [ Construction no. 1 ] (interactive installation) addresses concepts of resonance, feedback, deconstruction, and inundation in the contexts of sound, music, and social media. The installation is a collection of position-aware resonant acrylic cubes that, depending on their placement, respond with varying audio and projected visual.


Artist(s) Biography:

Jesse Allison holds an appointment in Experimental Music and Digital Media at Louisiana State University. As part of the Center for Computation and Technology's AVATAR initiative, he actively investigates, through research and collaboration, the intersection of technology and art.  Prior to coming to LSU, he helped found the Institute for Digital Intermedia Art at Ball State University. He is also President of Hardware Engineering of Electrotap, LLC, an innovative electronic arts company.

Currently he is enthralled with the relationship of location to sound and performance as manipulated by mobile technology, collaboration, perception, and time.  Allison has disseminated sonic artworks and research around the globe through live performance art, interactive installations, virtual and hybrid-world installations, and various writings on art and technology. Recent performances/exhibits include Siggraph, Techfest Bombay, ICMC, Pixilerations, Boston Cyberarts Festival, and SEAMUS.

Nick Hwang is a composer and sonic artist whose latest pursuits have involved interactive installations, sound art, and interactive environments. His output has been seen at ICMC, SEAMUS, ISIM, Symposium for Laptop Ensembles and Orchestras, and Pixilerations.

Michael Straus: Saxophonist, composer, and improviser Michael Straus has firmly established himself as an important voice for contemporary and experimental music through his ongoing collaborations with visual artists, composers, robots, turntablists, conductors, dancers and instrumentalists around the world. He is founder of the multimedia performance project What are you looking at? and regularly performs with the chamber ensembles Moonrise Hernandez, quux, M2Duo, Portals of Distortion and EAR Duo. His recordings as a performer, composer and improviser can be heard on Innova, Everglade, EcoSono, Audition Records, SEAMUS, New Tertian and The Walter's Art Museum record labels. Michael is the recipient of a 2010 American-Scandinavian Foundation Creative Arts Grant (Oslo) and 2008-2009 J. William Fulbright Fellowship (Amsterdam). He is currently a Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Music and Digital Media at Louisiana State University and holds M.M. degrees in saxophone performance and computer music from the Peabody Institute of The Johns Hopkins University.</p>
