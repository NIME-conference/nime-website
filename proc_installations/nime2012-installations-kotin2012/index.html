				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Whisker Organ is an interactive sound instrument linking the voices of a 30-person chorus with 48 black cat whiskers. Through touch, visitors to the piece activate the sound of massed voices singing, creating spontaneous, infinitely-variable musical compositions. Whisker Organ is built on a system of  piezoelectric sensors connected to a series of microprocessors, which in turn control sound output to an external speaker system. The sonic experience is oversized, unexpected, and richly human. The tactile experience is mysterious, perhaps evoking a frisson of discomfort, but also inescapably compelling. Whisker Organ both requires and enables the leap of imagination necessary to make sense of the joining of two organic but otherwise unconnected references. Whisker Organ was created in collaboration with the Oriana Consort who performed the vocal notes for the instrument. The music that forms the basis of Whisker Organ's sound output was composed in 2011 by Walter Chapin.
