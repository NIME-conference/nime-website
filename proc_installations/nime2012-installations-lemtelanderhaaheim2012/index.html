				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Mutatis Mutandis is a multi-sensory installation that uses glaciological data to control an audio and visual environment. This data is interpreted in several ways including using the data to control parameters of sound files containing actual recorded glaciers (calving, ice-cracking, melting, sheet friction, etc.) and processing the data to synthesize sound and visualizations. The glacial sounds were collected from researchers and acousticians across the world, much of it field recorded in Antarctica. These audio-processes are distributed to several speakers located around the space.

Because glaciological change can take place over extremely long durations of time, this installation exposes various characteristics of glaciological history by accelerating their rates of change. To symbolize the real-time aspect of glaciological change, a large ice block is placed in the middle of the space, slowly melting throughout the installation's duration.

This project uses data taken from all over the world including WGMS (World Glacier Monitoring Service), NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), CrESIS (Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets) and the US census bureau.

Artist(s) Biography:

Nolan Lem (b. 1986 Kansas City, MO) is an instrumentalist and composer whose work reflects a broad range of influences and mediums. His music has been performed all over the United States and abroad including festivals in Norway, Italy, Switzerland and Finland. As a saxophonist, he has performed at the Lincoln Center, Dizzy's Coca Cola Jazz Club and the Highline Ball room in New York City. He has been the recipient of several grants for installations involving the University of Kansas and the Spencer Art Museum. He has studied at the Sibelius Academy, Eastman School, the University of Kansas and holds a degree from the University of Miami (FL). He currently resides in Lawrence, KS where he is pursuing a degree in electrical engineering at the University of Kansas.

Tristan Telander (b. 1984 Wichita, KS) is a University of Kansas Visual Communications graduate currently employed as the Graphic Designer with the Spencer Museum of Art where she develops print, environmental, and digital materials. Her award-winning work---ranging from annual reports to exterior building banners---enhances the Spencer's multifaceted environment. Recently, she has been a recipient of two American Association of Museums Publication Design Competition prizes and a grant from The Commons at the University of Kansas. After work, Tristan paints in acrylic and oil, illustrates and designs on a freelance basis, and shoots 35mm film when the light is right. Tristan's goal is to continuously grow while exploring the field of visual communication as it changes with technological advances with regard to the environment.

Bryan Kip Haaheim joined the faculty at KU in 2001 as an assistant professor of Music Composition. He currently teaches Composition, Electronic Music, and Music Theory. Kip Received his D.M.A degree from the University of Arizona in 1999 after studying with Daniel Asia. He completed his Masters degree at the University of Minnesota under Alex Lubet, Dominick Argento, and Judith Zaimont.
In addition to more traditional chamber music Kip has an extensive portfolio of Electronic Music which features works for digital audio and performer, interactive multi-media installations, interactive websites, live web performance, and works for video and film. The collaborative work ``Sacred and Profane'' with Daniel Asia (Summitt Records) was one of the first surround-sound audio DVDs in the United States. Kip's works have received recent performances in New York City; Chicago; Detroit; Los Angeles; Houston; Eugene; San Francisco; Toronto, Canada, Tel Aviv, Israel; Paris, France; and Lübeck, Germany.</p>
