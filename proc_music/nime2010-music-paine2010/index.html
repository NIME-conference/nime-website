				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes: Grace Space is a new work for clarinet and realtime electronic transformation. It plays with sonic space and non-space; the use of the grace note to define relationships of transition from a forgotten or distant space to a familiar space, a known pitch. The piece contemplates memory, the experience of snapping out of a daydream, from distant imaginings or recollections to the real space, the events right in front of you. The realtime electronic transformation makes the space fluid and introduces a height ened depth of perspective. Surround sound spatialization techniques are used also to bring the sound of the clarinet off the stage and around the audience, subverting the audience as spectator relationship to one where the audience is at the core of the work, the position the performer usually occupies.

About the performers: Garth Paine has exhibited immersive interactive environments in Australia, Europe, Japan, USA, Hong Kong and New Zealand. He is on the organizing and peer review panels for the International Conference On New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME), the International Computer Music Conference. He has twice been guest editor of Organized Sound Journal (Cambridge University Press) for special editions on interactive systems in music and sound installation. He is often invited to run workshops on interactivity for musical performance and commissioned to develop interactive system for realtime musical composition for dance and theatre performances. He was selected as one of ten creative professionals internationally for exhibition in the 10th New York Digital Salon; DesignX Critical Reflections, and as a millennium leader of innovation by the German Keyboard Magazine in 2000. Dr Paine was awarded the Australia Council for the Arts, New Media Arts Fellowship in 2000, and The RMIT Innovation Research Award in 2002. He is a member of the advisory panel for the Electronic Music Foundation and one of 17 advisors to the UNESCO funded Symposium on the Future, which is developing a taxonomy / design space of electronic musical instruments. Recently Dr Paine been invited to perform at the Agora Festival, Centre Pompidou, Paris (2006) and the New York Electronic Arts Festival (2007), and in 2009 will perform in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Lymerik Ireland, New York City, Montreal and Quebec in Canada, and Phoenix Arizona. In 2008 Dr Paine received the UWS Vice-Chancellor's Excellence Award for Postgraduate Research Training and Supervision.
