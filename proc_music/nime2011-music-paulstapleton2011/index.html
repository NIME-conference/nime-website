				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>About the performers:

E=MCH is a recently formed quartet featuring Belfast-based improvisers Paul Stapleton (BoSS &amp; Postcard Weevil), Caroline Pugh (Voice &amp; Analogue Cassette Decks, Zero-input Mixer), Adnan Marquez-Borbon (Feedback Bass Clarinet, Recording Modules &amp; Delay Lines) and Cavan Fyans (DIY Electronics). Memories, distortions of time and place, echoes from analogue delay lengths, solid state samplers, and modified vinyl all help shape the fabric of the music in response to its larger ecology. ``Okay so making instruments and playing on them is not new, can't really see that there is any new thought about how why and what here, but the sound sculpture looks nice.'' --- Cosmopolitan

Paul Stapleton: Sound artist, improviser and writer originally from Southern California, currently lecturing at the Sonic Arts Research Centre in Belfast (SARC). Paul designs and performs with a variety of custom made metallic sound sculptures, electronics and found objects in locations ranging from impro clubs in Cork to abandoned beaches on Vancouver Island.

Caroline Pugh: Scottish vocalist and performance artist. She deviously borrows analogue technologies and oral histories to create performances that present imagined constructions of traditional and popular culture.  With a background in both folk music and improvisation, she collaborates with people from any discipline and performs in a wide variety of venues including folk clubs, arts venues and cinemas.

Adnan Marquez-Borbon: Saxophonist, improviser, computer musician, and composer, currently a PhD student at SARC. His research emphasis is on the roles of learning models and skill development in the design of digital musical instruments. As a musician, his music focuses on improvisation and the electronic manipulation of sounds in real-time.

Cavan Fyans: PhD research student, instrument builder, noise maker &amp; improviser. Currently located at SARC, Cavan's research examines the spectator's cognition of interaction and performance in communicative interactions with technology. Cavan also devotes time to developing new and innovative ways of breaking cheap electronic toys (Circuit Bending) and (re)constructing circuitry for sonic creation (Hardware Hacking).</p>
