				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Jack Walk explores notions of ecstatic energy, control and release. The work begins with live and fixed percussion lines, re-processed into a series of electronic representations of specified structure. This provides a compositional framework that a percussionist interacts with, while in another sonic layer, a laptop musician simultaneously samples and re-processes the live percussion while channeling the audio back into the larger environment. A videographer mixes imagery related to the original compositional notions of ecstatic control and release. Layers of sonic material emanating from the drummer's kit blur the virtual and real, while the music and imagery evoke imaginary lines tracing physical and conceptual flows of energy. The trio of performers for the NIME 2012 performance of Jack Walk (Deal, Drews, and Munson) comprise group known as Big Robot, an Indianapolis-based computer-acoustic trio that creates live, interactive, and media-enriched works.

Artist(s) Biography:

Scott Deal has premiered solo, chamber and mixed media works throughout North America Europe, and Asia. An artist who ``displays phenomenal virtuosity'' (Artsfuse) and presents a ``riveting performance'' (Sequenza 21), his recording of John Luther Adams's Four Thousand Holes, for piano, percussion, and electronics was listed in New Yorker Magazine's 2011 Top Ten Classical Recordings. In 2011, he and composer Matthew Burtner were awarded the Internet2 IDEA Award for their co-creation of Auksalaq, a telematic opera.  Deal is Professor of Music and Director of the Donald Louis Tavel Arts and Technology Research Center at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI). He is the founder and director of the Telematic Collective, a multi-disciplinary artistic research group comprised of graduate students and professional collaborators. He also serves on the faculty for the Summer Institute for Contemporary Performance Practice at the New England Conservatory.

Michael Drews is a composer, sound artist and computer musician. His work explores unconventional narrative strategies created from transforming contextual identity and the expressive power of cultural artifacts found in particular sonic and visual materials. Present throughout Drews's work is an interest in performance-based computer virtuosity and improvisational applications of computer technology that expand traditional ideas of musical performance and creativity. Drews is a member of computer-acoustic ensemble, Big Robot and the experimental-electronica duo, Mana2. Performances of Drews's compositions have been featured at SEAMUS, Cinesonika, Electronic Music Midwest, NYC Electronic Music Festival, Studio 300, PASIC, Super Computing Global and IASPM-Canada. Drews holds degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (D.M.A.), Cleveland State University (M.MUS.) and Kent State University (B.A.). He resides with his family in Indianapolis and is Assistant Professor of Music at Indiana University-Indianapolis (IUPUI). For more information: michaeldrews.org or Twitter.com/MICHAEL-DREWS

Jordan Munson is a musician, composer, and multimedia artist.  He is a Lecturer in Music and Arts Technology, and an associate of the Donald Louis Tavel Arts and Technology Research Center, both at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).  His works for multimedia and music have been premiered at institutions such as the University of Kentucky, the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and the University of California San Diego. As a video artist, he has shown work at New York City Electro-Acoustic Music Festival and SEAMUS. Munson's experimental electronic efforts have resulted in performances alongside artists such as Matmos, R. Luke DuBois and Bora Yoon. He is a member of the computer-acoustic ensemble Big Robot, in which he work focuses on live experimental percussion and electronics. Munson holds degrees from Indiana University in Indianapolis (M.S.M.T.) and the University of Kentucky (B.M.).
