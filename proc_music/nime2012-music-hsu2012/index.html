				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Flue is a structured audio-visual improvisation for three musicians, utilizing live acoustic and electronic sound and interactive animations. A physics-based smoke simulation is influenced by the real-time audio from the musicians' performance. The audio from the performance is analyzed; high-level tempo, spectral and other features are extracted, and sent via Open Sound Control to the animation environment. The smoke trails are also able to coalesce into well- defined symbols and forms, all while moving in a natural-seeming manner consistent with the underlying fluid simulation.
