				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Eigenspace (2011) is a collaborative project with Japan's leading visual artist in new media, Tomoyuki Kato (Movie Director), with Yoshito Onishi (Image Programing), and Chisako Hasegawa (Producer).  As Japanese, we were deeply touched by the Fukushima nuclear meltdown, the worst manmade catastrophe in the history of the human kind, which is not contained today contaminating the globe.  Eigenspace is about our love and prayer for the humankind and our planet, and for the next generation. The name is also taken from ``eigenvalue,'' a mathematical function used in analyzing the bowing movement, which interacts in real time with Mr. Kato's software.  The musical expression is extracted by IRCAM's ``Augmented Violin'' and their newest motion sensor ``mini-MO'', custom-fit into a glove designed by Mark Salinas. Special thanks to the Real Time Musical Interactive Team at IRCAM. Eigenspace was commissioned by Harvestworks, and premiered at Roulette in Brooklyn, on October 9th, 2011.

His highly acclaimed ``Grand Odyssey,'' created for 2005 Aichi Expo's Toshiba/Mitsui pavilion, is now displayed at Nagasaki's Huistenbosch theme-park. In 2010, Kato created ``Better Life from Japan,'' an exhibit for Otsuka Pharmaceutical company at Shanghai Expo, using a 360-degree display.
