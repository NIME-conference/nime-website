				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

When designing my new electronic instruments, I always keep in mind the relationship between the instrument and performer as a tool and its master. The instrument should be a channel by which the performer can access the dimensions of sound in order to attempt to make music. The music should then originate from the musicians intention and not the instrument itself. Thus, I design my instruments as intuitive, transparent, and non-idiosyncratic mappings between physical gesture and sound.

This new electronic instrument remaps a Logitech Attack 3 Joystick to be able to control sound. Through the joystick, the performer can control volume, rhythm, repetition, and pitch of custom, preprogrammed sounds. Additionally, the joystick can be used to record and playback short audio loops. The product of this design allows for agile and intentional electronic musical gestures where rhythm, volume, and pitch are clear and deliberate. I have been able to reach a wide range of musical expressions and I am learning and discovering more as I practice MODIFIED ATTACK.
