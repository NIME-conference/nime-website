				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

Clarinet is the third piece in a series of monotimbral works.  Like its siblings Piano and Cymbal, it was inspired by the sound qualities of an acoustic instrument. This minimalist and meditative piece is a structured improvisation performed on the sponge, a musical interface designed by the composer. The sponge is basically a cushion equipped with sensors (accelerometers, buttons and force sensing resistors) which detect when it is squeezed, twisted or shaken.  Because the sponge evolves continuously, the piece exists in many versions.  Each new version drifts further away from the original compositional intentions and the piece is slowly becoming less meditative.  The latest version is subtitled Albino Butterfly.

Artist(s) Biography:

Martin Marier is a composer and a performer who is mainly interested in live electronic music using new interfaces.  He is the inventor of the sponge, a cushion like musical interface that he uses to perform his pieces.  The main goal of this approach is to establish a natural link between gesture and sound in electronic music.  He aims at improving the interaction with the audience and at making the process of composing more playful.  His research on the sponge is the topic of the doctorate he is pursuing at the Universit de Montral under the supervision of Prof. Jean Piché.  He was also supervised by Dr. Garth Paine during an exchange at the University of Western Sydney (Australia) in 2011.
Martin has also composed music for theatre, collaborating mostly with the Thé\^atre I.N.K. company for whom he wrote the music of three plays: "L'effet du temps sur Matévina" (2012), "Roche, papier... couteau" (2007), "La cadette" (2006).  He sometimes writes music for films and collaborates with the film composer Benoit Charest. He is one of the founders of Point d'écoute (PDE), a collective whose purpose is to promote electroacoustic music.  Along with his four colleagues of PDE, he produced concerts in Montreal, New York and Sydney.

Concert Venue and Time: Lydia Mendelssohn Theatre, Monday May 21, 9:00pm</p>
