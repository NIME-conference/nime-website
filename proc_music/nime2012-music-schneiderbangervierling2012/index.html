				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

The piece Floating Points II is the result of the continued work of the instrument makers and performers Michael Vierling and Matthias Schneiderbanger within their self-developed system for collaborative performance including the digital musical instruments Sensor-table and Chirotron. These instruments use several sensors to transform the movements and gestures of their players into data for sound generation, placement and movement of the sound in the room.

The performances with Sensor-table and Chirotron emphasize the connection between the performer and the digital musical instruments by using the basic noise of the sensors as a notable characteristic in the sound synthesis to accentuate the technical boundaries in an aesthetic way. The network is the core of the common setup: It offers the ability to connect two physically separated instruments into one common signal chain for sound processing and spatialisation.

Michael Vierling studies music informatics master at the Karlsruhe University of Music, Germany. He is drummer in several band projects and teaches a drumclass at School for Music and Performing Arts in Bühl, Germany. His main interests besides producing and performing music are sonic arts especially live- electronics, creating digital music instruments and sound installations with use of sensor technologies. Since 2010, there is an artistic collaboration with M. Schneiderbanger in the development of digital musical instruments. Their instruments were presented 2011 at the Music and Sonic Arts Symposium in Baden-Baden, performances include, the NIME 2012 in Michigan and the Network Music Festival 2012 in Birmingham. His works have been exhibited at various Festivals e.g. ton:art 2010/11, UND 6/7, Sommerloch 2011, Beyond 3D-Festival in Karlsruhe and the Next Level Conference in Cologne.
