				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>Program notes:

This piece consists of a partially pre-composed acousmatic composition actualized in real time by hand motion. The audio generated by the hand motions is analyzed, colorized and projected beside the performer during the performance. The motions and content of this piece are inspired by the late Merce Cunningham and this performance is dedicated to him.
