				<h2>Abstract:</h2>
				
				<p>BANDNAME is composed of three womxn NAME, NAME, and NAME and guests who use the physical properties of the electromagnetic spectrum to create installations, performances and recordings. Using electronic feedback, audio speakers, various kinds of microphones/pickups, and resonant objects of all shapes and kinds, we summon the feminine spirit of electromagnetism, aka the Goddess of the Electronic Medium aka the ElecroMagnetic Goddess. We have a flexible membership inclusive to all peoples who are willing to open themselves up to this spirit. In terms of current trends in audio technology, we invoke a feminist response to the masculinization of the music industry, audio engineering, and to the artistic spaces of sound arts in general.  Our latest project includes playing with painted score-objects Bareëmins. They are painted with conductive carbon paint, and non-conductive paint. When the area that is conductive is activated it produces sound, the non-conductive area does not. Thereby, by alternating painted and not painted areas in an aesthetic way, a score can be embedded into the very instrument itself. The paint can be applied to paintings as well as the inside of paper and plastic sculptures the results are many fold.  There are folded paper crystal Bareëmins that look like crystals suitable for an electromagnetic altar. You can use them to invoke the Electromagnetic Goddess at home.   The project is particularly aligned with this year's theme of Frugal Music Innovation as it uses all natural materials + paste glue to create the painted score/instrument. The carbon paint is made by recycling charcoal from a cooking fire, the colored paint is everyday school supplies and paint made out of found earth pigment. The binder is paste glue. The brains are an Arduino running simple theremin code with only 2 resistors and an 8ohm speaker as peripherals.   video here   https://youtu.be/YAD-F68Ntl4</p>
